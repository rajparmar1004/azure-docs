By mapping private endpoints to your premium container registry resources, you can reduce data leakage risks. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/privateendpoints](../../../../articles/event-grid/configure-private-endpoints.md) and [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md). |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PrivateEndpoint_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
|[Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F5b9159ae-1701-4a6f-9a7a-aa9c8ddd0580) |Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents of your registries. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management.

Data cannot be moved out of the registry via 'acr import' or via 'acr transfer'. In order to disable exports, public network access must be disabled. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/export-policy](../../../../articles/container-registry/data-loss-prevention.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_ExportPolicy_AuditDeny.json) |

|[Container registries should have SKUs that support Private Links](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fbd560fc0-3c69-498a-ae9f-aa8eb7de0e13) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more at: [https://aka.ms/acr/private-link](../../../../articles/container-registry/container-registry-private-link.md). |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_SkuSupportsPrivateEndpoints_AuditDeny.json) |

To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific private endpoints, public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have network rules configured, it will appear in the unhealthy resources.

Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of container registry resources.
