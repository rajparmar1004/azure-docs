Deploy Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on your target device.

<!-- 1.1 -->
:::moniker range="iotedge-2018-06"

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Install IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on your target device.

> [!NOTE]
> The following PowerShell process outlines how to deploy IoT Edge for Linux on Windows onto the local device. To deploy to a remote target device using PowerShell, you can use [Remote PowerShell](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote) to establish a connection to a remote device and run these commands remotely on that device.

1. In an elevated PowerShell session, run each of the following commands to download IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

   ```powershell
   $msiPath = $([io.Path]::Combine($env:TEMP, 'AzureIoTEdge.msi'))
   $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
   Invoke-WebRequest "https://aka.ms/AzEflowMSI" -OutFile $msiPath
   ```

1. Install IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on your device.

   ```powershell
   Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList "/i","$([io.Path]::Combine($env:TEMP, 'AzureIoTEdge.msi'))","/qn"
   ```

   You can specify custom IoT Edge for Linux on Windows installation and VHDX directories by adding `INSTALLDIR="<FULLY_QUALIFIED_PATH>"` and `VHDXDIR="<FULLY_QUALIFIED_PATH>"` parameters to the install command.

1. Set the execution policy on the target device to `AllSigned` if it is not already. See the PowerShell prerequisites for commands to check the current execution policy and set the execution policy to `AllSigned`.

1. Create the IoT Edge for Linux on Windows deployment. The deployment creates your Linux virtual machine and installs the IoT Edge runtime for you.

   ```powershell
   Deploy-Eflow
   ```

   >[!TIP]
   >By default, the `Deploy-Eflow` command creates your Linux virtual machine with 1 GB of RAM, 1 vCPU core, and 16 GB of disk space. However, the resources your VM needs are highly dependent on the workloads you deploy. If your VM does not have sufficient memory to support your workloads, it will fail to start.
   >
   >You can customize the virtual machine's available resources using the `Deploy-Eflow` command's optional parameters.
   >
   >For example, the command below creates a virtual machine with 4 vCPU cores, 4 GB of RAM (represented in MB), and 20 GB of disk space:
   >
   >   ```powershell
   >   Deploy-Eflow -cpuCount 4 -memoryInMB 4096 -vmDiskSize 20
   >   ```
   >
   >For information about all the optional parameters available, see [PowerShell functions for IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](../articles/iot-edge/reference-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows-functions.md#deploy-eflow).

   >[!WARNING]
   >By default, the EFLOW Linux virtual machine has no DNS configuration. Deployments using DHCP will try to obtain the DNS configuration propagated by the DHCP server. Please check your DNS configuration to ensure internet connectivity. For more information, see [AzEFLOW-DNS](https://aka.ms/AzEFLOW-DNS).

   You can assign a GPU to your deployment to enable GPU-accelerated Linux modules. To gain access to these features, you will need to install the prerequisites detailed in [GPU acceleration for Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](../articles/iot-edge/gpu-acceleration.md).

   To use a GPU passthrough, add the **gpuName**, **gpuPassthroughType**, and **gpuCount** parameters to your `Deploy-Eflow` command. For information about all the optional parameters available, see [PowerShell functions for IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](../articles/iot-edge/reference-iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows-functions.md#deploy-eflow).

   >[!WARNING]
   >Enabling hardware device passthrough may increase security risks. Microsoft recommends a device mitigation driver from your GPU's vendor, when applicable. For more information, see [Deploy graphics devices using discrete device assignment](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/deploy/deploying-graphics-devices-using-dda).

1. Enter 'Y' to accept the license terms.

1. Enter 'O' or 'R' to toggle **Optional diagnostic data** on or off, depending on your preference.

1. Once the deployment is complete, the PowerShell window reports **Deployment successful**.

   ![A successful deployment will say 'Deployment successful' at the end of the messages, PNG.](./media/iot-edge-install-linux-on-windows/successful-powershell-deployment.png)

   After a successful deployment, you are ready to provision your device.

# [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windowsadmincenter)

>[!NOTE]
>The Azure IoT Edge extension for Windows Admin Center is currently in [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). The management process may be different than for generally available features.

1. [Install](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-admin-center) and open Windows Admin Center.

   On the Windows Admin Center start page, under the list of connections, you will see a local host connection representing the PC where you are running Windows Admin Center. Any additional servers, PCs, or clusters that you manage will also show up here.

   You can use Windows Admin Center to manage Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on either your local device or remote managed devices. In this guide, the local host connection will serve as the target device for the deployment of Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

1. Confirm that your local device is listed under **All connections**, like shown below.

   ![Initial Windows Admin Center dashboard with target device listed, PNG.](./media/iot-edge-install-linux-on-windows/windows-admin-center-initial-dashboard.png)

   If you want to deploy to a remote target device instead of your local device and you do not see your desired target device in the list, follow the [instructions to add your device](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/use/get-started#connecting-to-managed-nodes-and-clusters).

1. Select **+ Add** to begin creating your deployment. The deployment creates your Linux virtual machine and installs the IoT Edge runtime for you.

1. On the **Add or create resources** pane, locate the **Azure IoT Edge** tile. Select **Create new** to install a new instance of Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows on a device.

   If you already have IoT Edge for Linux on Windows running on a device, you could select **Add** to connect to that existing IoT Edge device and manage it with Windows Admin Center.

   ![Select Create New on Azure IoT Edge tile in Windows Admin Center, PNG.](./media/iot-edge-install-linux-on-windows/resource-creation-tiles.png)

1. The **Create an Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows deployment** pane will open. On the **1. Getting Started** tab, review the minimum requirements and select **Next**.

1. Review the license terms, check **I Accept**, and select **Next**.

1. You can toggle **Optional diagnostic data** on or off, depending on your preference.

1. Select **Next: Deploy**.

   ![Select the Next: Deploy button after toggling optional diagnostic data to your preference, PNG.](./media/iot-edge-install-linux-on-windows/select-next-deploy.png)

1. On the **2. Deploy** tab, under **Select a target device**, click on your listed device to validate it meets the minimum requirements. Once its status is confirmed as supported, select **Next**.

   ![Select your device to verify it is supported, PNG.](./media/iot-edge-install-linux-on-windows/evaluate-supported-device.png)

1. On the **2.2 Settings** tab, review the configuration settings of your deployment. The table below shows the settings and their default values.

   | Setting | Default value |
   | ------- | ------------- |
   | Virtual disk size in GB | 16 |
   | Memory in MB **(even number)** | 1024 |
   | Number of cores | 2 |
   | Azure IoT Edge version | 1.1 (LTS) |

   >[!NOTE]
   >IoT Edge for Linux on Windows uses a default switch, which assigns the Linux virtual machine an internal IP address. This internal IP address cannot be reached from outside the Windows machine. You can connect to the virtual machine locally while logged onto the Windows machine.
   >
   >If you are using Windows Server, [set up a default switch](../articles/iot-edge/how-to-create-virtual-switch.md) before deploying IoT Edge for Linux on Windows.

   You can assign a GPU to your deployment to enable GPU-accelerated Linux modules. To gain access to these features, you will need to install the prerequisites detailed in [GPU acceleration for Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](../articles/iot-edge/gpu-acceleration.md). If you are only installing these prerequisites at this point in the deployment process, you will need to start again from the beginning.

   There are two options for GPU passthrough available: **Direct Device Assignment (DDA)** and **GPU Paravirtualization (GPU-PV)**, depending on the GPU adaptor you assign to your deployment.

   For the direct device assignment method, select the number of GPU processors to allocate to your Linux virtual machine.

   For the paravirtualization method, no additional settings are needed.

   >[!WARNING]
   >Enabling hardware device passthrough may increase security risks. Microsoft recommends a device mitigation driver from your GPU's vendor, when applicable. For more information, see [Deploy graphics devices using discrete device assignment](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/deploy/deploying-graphics-devices-using-dda).

   Once you are satisfied with the settings, select **Next**.

1. On the **2.3 Deployment** tab, you can watch the progress of the deployment. The full process includes downloading the Azure IoT Edge for Linux on Windows package, installing the package, configuring the host device, and setting up the Linux virtual machine. This process may take several minutes to complete. A successful deployment is pictured below.

   ![A successful deployment will show each step with a green check mark and a 'Complete' label, PNG.](./media/iot-edge-install-linux-on-windows/successful-deployment.png)

1. Once your deployment is complete, you are ready to provision your device. Select **Next: Connect** to proceed to the **3. Connect** tab, which handles Azure IoT Edge device provisioning.
