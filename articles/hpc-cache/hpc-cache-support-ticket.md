# Contact support for help with Azure HPC Cache

The best way to get help with Azure HPC Cache is to use the Azure portal to open a support ticket.

Navigate to your cache instance, then click the **New support request** link that appears at the bottom of the sidebar.

To open a ticket when you do not have an active cache, use the main Help + support page from the Azure portal. Open the portal menu from the control at the top left of the screen, then scroll to the bottom and click **Help + support**.

Support requests are also used to request a quota increase. If you want to host more HPC Caches than your subscription currently allows, follow the instructions below in [Request a quota increase](#request-a-quota-increase).

## Request technical support

Choose **Create a support request**. On the support request form, write a summary of the issue, and select **Technical** as the **Issue type**.

Select your subscription from the list.

If you can't find the Azure HPC Cache service, click the **All services** button and search for HPC.

Fill out the rest of the fields with your information and preferences, then submit the ticket when you are ready.

After you submit the request, you will receive a confirmation email with a ticket number. A support staff member will contact you about the request.

## Request a quota increase

Use the quotas page in the Azure portal to check your current quotas and request increases.

The default quota for Azure HPC Cache is four caches per subscription. If you want to create more than six caches in the same subscription, support approval is needed. One HPC Cache uses multiple virtual machines, network resources, storage containers, and other Azure services, so it's unlikely that the number of caches per subscription will be the limiting factor in how many you can have.

Use the support request form described above to request a quota increase.

* For **Issue type**, select **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**.

* Select the **Subscription** for the quota increase.

* Select the **Quota type** "HPC Cache".

  Click **Next** to go to the **Additional details** page.

* In **Request details**, click the link that says **Enter details**. An additional form opens to the right.

* Type the limit you're requesting in the **New limit** field. Click **Save and continue**.

  Fill in the additional details required and create the request.
