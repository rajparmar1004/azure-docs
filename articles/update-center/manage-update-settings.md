## Configure settings on single VM

To configure update settings on your machines on a single VM, follow these steps:

>[!NOTE]
> You can schedule updates from the Overview or Machines blade in update management center (preview) page or from the selected VM.

# [From Overview blade](#tab/manage-single-overview)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In **Update management center**, select **Overview**, select your **Subscription**, and select **Update settings**.
1. In **Change update settings**, select the update settings that you want to change for your machine and select **Next**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-update-settings/update-setting-to-change.png" alt-text="Highlighting the Update settings to change option in the Azure portal.":::
 
    The following update settings are available for configuration for the selected machine(s):

   - **Periodic assessment** - enable periodic **Assessment** to run every 24 hours.
     >[!NOTE]
     > You must [register for the periodic assessement](/azure/update-center/enable-machines?branch=release-updatecenterv2-publicpreview&tabs=portal-periodic%2Cps-periodic-assessment%2Ccli-periodic-assessment%2Crest-periodic-assessment) in your Azure subscription to enable this feature.

    - **Hot patching** - for Azure VMs, you can enable [hot patching](/azure/automanage/automanage-hotpatch) on supported Windows Server Azure Edition Virtual Machines (VMs) don't require a reboot after installation. You can use update management center (preview) to install patches with other patch classifications or to schedule patch installation when you require immediate critical patch deployment.

    - **Patch orchestration** option provides the following:

      - **Automatic by operating system** - When the workload running on the VM doesn't have to meet availability targets, operating system updates are automatically downloaded and installed. Machines are rebooted as needed.
      - **Azure-orchestrated (preview)** - Available *Critical* and *Security* patches are downloaded and applied automatically on the Azure VM using [automatic VM guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching). This process kicks off automatically every month when new patches are released. Patch assessment and installation are automatic, and the process includes rebooting the VM as required.
      - **Manual updates** - Configures the Windows Update agent by setting [configure automatic updates](/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/deploy/4-configure-group-policy-settings-for-automatic-updates#configure-automatic-updates).
      - **Image Default** - Only supported for Linux Virtual Machines, this mode honors the default patching configuration in the image used to create the VM.
