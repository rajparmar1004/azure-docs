# Azure Functions runtime versions overview

<a name="top"></a>Azure Functions currently supports several versions of the runtime host. The following table details the available versions, their support level, and when they should be used:

| Version | Support level | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.x | GA | **_Recommended runtime version for functions in all languages._** Use this version to [run C# functions on .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0, and .NET Framework 4.8](functions-dotnet-class-library.md#supported-versions). |
| 3.x | GA | Supports all languages. Use this version to [run C# functions on .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5.0](functions-dotnet-class-library.md#supported-versions).|
| 2.x | GA | Supported for [legacy version 2.x apps](#pinning-to-version-20). This version is in maintenance mode, with enhancements provided only in later versions.|
| 1.x | GA | Recommended only for C# apps that must use .NET Framework and only supports development in the Azure portal, Azure Stack Hub portal, or locally on Windows computers. This version is in maintenance mode, with enhancements provided only in later versions. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beginning on December 3, 2022, function apps running on versions 2.x and 3.x of the Azure Functions runtime can no longer be supported. Before that time, please test, verify, and migrate your function apps to version 4.x of the Functions runtime. For more information, see [Migrating from 3.x to 4.x](#migrating-from-3x-to-4x).  
>End of support for these runtime versions is due to the ending of support for .NET Core 3.1, which is required by these older runtime versions. This requirement affects all Azure Functions runtime languages.  
>Functions version 1.x is still supported for C# function apps that require the .NET Framework. Preview support is now available in Functions 4.x to [run C# functions on .NET Framework 4.8](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md#supported-versions). 

This article details some of the differences between these versions, how you can create each version, and how to change the version on which your functions run.

[!INCLUDE [functions-support-levels](../../includes/functions-support-levels.md)]

## Languages

All functions in a function app must share the same language. You chose the language of functions in your function app when you create the app. The language of your function app is maintained in the [FUNCTIONS\_WORKER\_RUNTIME](functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_runtime) setting, and shouldn't be changed when there are existing functions. 

The following table indicates which programming languages are currently supported in each runtime version.

[!INCLUDE [functions-supported-languages](../../includes/functions-supported-languages.md)]

## <a name="creating-1x-apps"></a>Run on a specific version

By default, function apps created in the Azure portal and by the Azure CLI are set to version 4.x. You can modify this version if needed. You can only downgrade the runtime version to 1.x after you create your function app but before you add any functions. Moving to a later version is allowed even with apps that have existing functions. When your app has existing functions, be aware of any breaking changes between versions before moving to a later runtime version. The following sections detail changes between versions:

+ [Between 3.x and 4.x](#breaking-changes-between-3x-and-4x) 
+ [Between 2.x and 3.x](#breaking-changes-between-2x-and-3x)
+ [Between 1.x and later versions](#migrating-from-1x-to-later-versions)

Before making a change to the major version of the runtime, you should first test your existing code on the new runtime version. You can verify your app runs correctly after the upgrade by deploying to another function app running on the latest major version. You can also verify your code locally by using the runtime-specific version of the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md), which includes the Functions runtime. 

Downgrades to v2.x aren't supported. When possible, you should always run your apps on the latest supported version of the Functions runtime. 

### Changing version of apps in Azure

The version of the Functions runtime used by published apps in Azure is dictated by the [`FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`](functions-app-settings.md#functions_extension_version) application setting. The following major runtime version values are supported:

| Value | Runtime target |
| ------ | -------- |
| `~4` | 4.x |
| `~3` | 3.x |
| `~2` | 2.x |
| `~1` | 1.x |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Don't arbitrarily change this app setting, because other app setting changes and changes to your function code may be required. You should instead change this setting in the **Function runtime settings** tab of the function app **Configuration** in the Azure portal when you are ready to make a major version upgrade.

To learn more, see [How to target Azure Functions runtime versions](set-runtime-version.md).  

### Pinning to a specific minor version

To resolve issues your function app may have when running on the latest major version, you have to temporarily pin your app to a specific minor version. Pinning gives you time to get your app running correctly on the latest major version. The way that you pin to a minor version differs between Windows and Linux. To learn more, see [How to target Azure Functions runtime versions](set-runtime-version.md).

Older minor versions are periodically removed from Functions. For the latest news about Azure Functions releases, including the removal of specific older minor versions, monitor [Azure App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues). 

### Pinning to version ~2.0

.NET function apps running on version 2.x (`~2`) are automatically upgraded to run on .NET Core 3.1, which is a long-term support version of .NET Core 3. Running your .NET functions on .NET Core 3.1 allows you to take advantage of the latest security updates and product enhancements. 

Any function app pinned to `~2.0` continues to run on .NET Core 2.2, which no longer receives security and other updates. To learn more, see [Functions v2.x considerations](functions-dotnet-class-library.md#functions-v2x-considerations). 

## Minimum extension versions

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
There's technically not a correlation between binding extension versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for all trigger and binding extensions. 

If you receive a warning about a package not meeting a minimum required version, you should update that NuGet package to the minimum version as you normally would. The minimum version requirements for extensions used in Functions v4.x can be found in [the linked configuration file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/blob/v4.x/src/WebJobs.Script/extensionrequirements.json).

For C# script, update the extension bundle reference in the host.json as follows:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "extensionBundle": {
        "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
        "version": "[2.*, 3.0.0)"
    }
}
```

There's technically not a correlation between extension bundle versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for extension bundles. 

If you receive a warning about your extension bundle version not meeting a minimum required version, update your existing extension bundle reference in the host.json as follows:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "extensionBundle": {
        "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
        "version": "[2.*, 3.0.0)"
    }
}
```  

To learn more about extension bundles, see [Extension bundles](functions-bindings-register.md#extension-bundles).

## <a name="migrating-from-3x-to-4x"></a>Migrating from 3.x to 4.x

Azure Functions version 4.x is highly backwards compatible to version 3.x. Most apps should safely upgrade to 4.x without requiring significant code changes. An upgrade is initiated when you set the `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` app setting to a value of `~4`. For function apps running on Windows, you also need to set the `netFrameworkVersion` site setting to target .NET 6. 

Before you upgrade your app to version 4.x of the Functions runtime, you should do the following tasks:

* Review the list of [breaking changes between 3.x and 4.x](#breaking-changes-between-3x-and-4x).
* [Run the pre-upgrade validator](#run-the-pre-upgrade-validator).
* When possible, [upgrade your local project environment to version 4.x](#upgrade-your-local-project). Fully test your app locally using version 4.x of the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md). When you use Visual Studio to publish a version 4.x project to an existing function app at a lower version, you're prompted to let Visual Studio upgrade the function app to version 4.x during deployment. This upgrade uses the same process defined in [Migrate without slots](#migrate-without-slots).
* Consider using a [staging slot](functions-deployment-slots.md) to test and verify your app in Azure on the new runtime version. You can then deploy your app with the updated version settings to the production slot. For more information, see [Migrate using slots](#migrate-using-slots).  

### Run the pre-upgrade validator

Azure Functions provides a pre-upgrade validator to help you identify potential issues when migrating your function app to 4.x. To run the pre-upgrade validator:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your function app.

1. Open the **Diagnose and solve problems** page.

1. In **Function App Diagnostics**, start typing `Functions 4.x Pre-Upgrade Validator` and then choose it from the list. 

1.  After validation completes, review the recommendations and address any issues in your app. If you need to make changes to your app, make sure to validate the changes against version 4.x of the Functions runtime, either [locally using Azure Functions Core Tools v4](#upgrade-your-local-project) or by [using a staging slot](#migrate-using-slots). 

### Migrate without slots

The simplest way to upgrade to v4.x is to set the `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` application setting to `~4` on your function app in Azure. When your function app runs on Windows, you also need to update the `netFrameworkVersion` site setting in Azure. You must follow a [different procedure](#migrate-using-slots) on a site with slots. 

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az functionapp config appsettings set --settings FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION=~4 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -n <APP_NAME>
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Update-AzFunctionAppSetting -AppSetting @{FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION = "~4"} -Name <APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -Force
```

---

When running on Windows, you also need to enable .NET 6.0, which is required by version 4.x of the runtime.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az functionapp config set --net-framework-version v6.0 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -n <APP_NAME>
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell
Set-AzWebApp -NetFrameworkVersion v6.0 -Name <APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>
```
---

In these examples, replace `<APP_NAME>` with the name of your function app and `<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>` with the name of the resource group.

### Migrate using slots

Using [deployment slots](functions-deployment-slots.md) is a good way to migrate your function app to the v4.x runtime from a previous version. By using a staging slot, you can run your app on the new runtime version in the staging slot and switch to production after verification. Slots also provide a way to minimize downtime during upgrade. If you need to minimize downtime, follow the steps in [Minimum downtime upgrade](#minimum-downtime-upgrade).    

After you've verified your app in the upgraded slot, you can swap the app and new version settings into production. This swap requires setting [`WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0`](functions-app-settings.md#website_override_sticky_extension_versions) in the production slot. How you add this setting affects the amount of downtime required for the upgrade. 

#### Standard upgrade

If your slot-enabled function app can handle the downtime of a full restart, you can update the `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS` setting directly in the production slot. Because changing this setting directly in the production slot causes a restart that impacts availability, consider doing this change at a time of reduced traffic. You can then swap in the upgraded version from the staging slot. 

The [`Update-AzFunctionAppSetting`](/powershell/module/az.functions/update-azfunctionappsetting) PowerShell cmdlet doesn't currently support slots. You must use Azure CLI or the Azure portal.

1. Use the following command to set `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0` in the production slot:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0  -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> 
    ```
    This command causes the app running in the production slot to restart. 

1. Use the following command to also set `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS` in the staging slot:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```

1. Use the following command to change `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` and upgrade the staging slot to the new runtime version:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION=~4 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```

1. (Windows only) For function apps running on Windows, use the following command so that the runtime can run on .NET 6:
   
    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config set --net-framework-version v6.0 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```

    Version 4.x of the Functions runtime requires .NET 6 when running on Windows. 

1. If your code project required any updates to run on version 4.x, deploy those updates to the staging slot now.

1. Confirm that your function app runs correctly in the upgraded staging environment before swapping.

1. Use the following command to swap the upgraded staging slot to production:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp deployment slot swap -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME> --target-slot production
    ```

#### Minimum downtime upgrade

To minimize the downtime in your production app, you can swap the `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS` setting from the staging slot into production. After that, you can swap in the upgraded version from a prewarmed staging slot. 

1. Use the following command to set `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0` in the staging slot:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```
1. Use the following commands to swap the slot with the new setting into production, and at the same time restore the version setting in the staging slot. 

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp deployment slot swap -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME> --target-slot production
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION=~3 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```

    You may see errors from the staging slot during the time between the swap and the runtime version being restored on staging. This can happen because having `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0` only in staging during a swap removes the `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` setting in staging. Without the version setting, your slot is in a bad state. Updating the version in the staging slot right after the swap should put the slot back into a good state, and you call roll back your changes if needed. However, any rollback of the swap also requires you to directly remove `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0` from production before the swap back to prevent the same errors in production seen in staging. This change in the production setting would then cause a restart.

1. Use the following command to again set `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0` in the staging slot:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```

    At this point, both slots have `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_EXTENSION_VERSIONS=0` set.

1. Use the following command to change `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` and upgrade the staging slot to the new runtime version:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config appsettings set --settings FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION=~4 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```

1. (Windows only) For function apps running on Windows, use the following command so that the runtime can run on .NET 6:
   
    ```azurecli
    az functionapp config set --net-framework-version v6.0 -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME>
    ```

    Version 4.x of the Functions runtime requires .NET 6 when running on Windows. 

1. If your code project required any updates to run on version 4.x, deploy those updates to the staging slot now.

1. Confirm that your function app runs correctly in the upgraded staging environment before swapping.

1. Use the following command to swap the upgraded and prewarmed staging slot to production:

    ```azurecli
    az functionapp deployment slot swap -g <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>  -n <APP_NAME> --slot <SLOT_NAME> --target-slot production
    ```

### Upgrade your local project

Upgrading instructions are language dependent. If you don't see your language, choose it from the switcher at the [top of the article](#top).

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
To update a C# class library project to .NET 6 and Azure Functions 4.x:

### Breaking changes between 3.x and 4.x

The following are some changes to be aware of before upgrading a 3.x app to 4.x. For a full list, see Azure Functions GitHub issues labeled [*Breaking Change: Approved*](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Breaking+Change%3A+Approved%22+is%3A%22closed+OR+open%22). More changes are expected during the preview period. Subscribe to [App Service Announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues) for updates.

## Migrating from 2.x to 3.x

Azure Functions version 3.x is highly backwards compatible to version 2.x.  Many apps can safely upgrade to 3.x without any code changes. While moving to 3.x is encouraged, run extensive tests before changing the major version in production apps.

### Breaking changes between 2.x and 3.x

The following are the language-specific changes to be aware of before upgrading a 2.x app to 3.x.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"
The main differences between versions when running .NET class library functions is the .NET Core runtime. Functions version 2.x is designed to run on .NET Core 2.2 and version 3.x is designed to run on .NET Core 3.1.  

* [Synchronous server operations are disabled by default](/dotnet/core/compatibility/2.2-3.0#http-synchronous-io-disabled-in-all-servers).

* Breaking changes introduced by .NET Core in [version 3.1](/dotnet/core/compatibility/3.1) and [version 3.0](/dotnet/core/compatibility/3.0), which aren't specific to Functions but might still affect your app.

>[!NOTE]
>Due to support issues with .NET Core 2.2, function apps pinned to version 2 (`~2`) are essentially running on .NET Core 3.1. To learn more, see [Functions v2.x compatibility mode](functions-dotnet-class-library.md#functions-v2x-considerations).

::: zone-end  
::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"  

* Output bindings assigned through 1.x `context.done` or return values now behave the same as setting in 2.x+ `context.bindings`.

* Timer trigger object is camelCase instead of PascalCase

* Event hub triggered functions with `dataType` binary will receive an array of `binary` instead of `string`.

* The HTTP request payload can no longer be accessed via `context.bindingData.req`.  It can still be accessed as an input parameter, `context.req`, and in `context.bindings`.

* Node.js 8 is no longer supported and won't execute in 3.x functions.
::: zone-end 

## Migrating from 1.x to later versions

You may choose to migrate an existing app written to use the version 1.x runtime to instead use a newer version. Most of the changes you need to make are related to changes in the language runtime, such as C# API changes between .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET Core. You'll also need to make sure your code and libraries are compatible with the language runtime you choose. Finally, be sure to note any changes in trigger, bindings, and features highlighted below. For the best migration results, you should create a new function app in a new version and port your existing version 1.x function code to the new app.  

While it's possible to do an "in-place" upgrade by manually updating the app configuration, going from 1.x to a higher version includes some breaking changes. For example, in C#, the debugging object is changed from `TraceWriter` to `ILogger`. By creating a new version 3.x project, you start off with updated functions based on the latest version 3.x templates.

### Changes in triggers and bindings after version 1.x

Starting with version 2.x, you must install the extensions for specific triggers and bindings used by the functions in your app. The only exception for this HTTP and timer triggers, which don't require an extension.  For more information, see [Register and install binding extensions](./functions-bindings-register.md).

There are also a few changes in the *function.json* or attributes of the function between versions. For example, the Event Hubs `path` property is now `eventHubName`. See the [existing binding table](#bindings) for links to documentation for each binding.

### Changes in features and functionality after version 1.x

A few features were removed, updated, or replaced after version 1.x. This section details the changes you see in later versions after having used version 1.x.

In version 2.x, the following changes were made:

* Keys for calling HTTP endpoints are always stored encrypted in Azure Blob storage. In version 1.x, keys were stored in Azure Files by default. When you upgrade an app from version 1.x to version 2.x, existing secrets that are in Azure Files are reset.

* The version 2.x runtime doesn't include built-in support for webhook providers. This change was made to improve performance. You can still use HTTP triggers as endpoints for webhooks.

* The host configuration file (host.json) should be empty or have the string `"version": "2.0"`.

* To improve monitoring, the WebJobs dashboard in the portal, which used the [`AzureWebJobsDashboard`](functions-app-settings.md#azurewebjobsdashboard) setting is replaced with Azure Application Insights, which uses the [`APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`](functions-app-settings.md#appinsights_instrumentationkey) setting. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring.md).

* All functions in a function app must share the same language. When you create a function app, you must choose a runtime stack for the app. The runtime stack is specified by the [`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`](functions-app-settings.md#functions_worker_runtime) value in application settings. This requirement was added to improve footprint and startup time. When developing locally, you must also include this setting in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file).

* The default timeout for functions in an App Service plan is changed to 30 minutes. You can manually change the timeout back to unlimited by using the [functionTimeout](functions-host-json.md#functiontimeout) setting in host.json.

* HTTP concurrency throttles are implemented by default for Consumption plan functions, with a default of 100 concurrent requests per instance. You can change this behavior in the [`maxConcurrentRequests`](functions-host-json.md#http) setting in the host.json file.

* Because of [.NET Core limitations](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/issues/3414), support for F# script (`.fsx` files) functions has been removed. Compiled F# functions (.fs) are still supported.

* The URL format of Event Grid trigger webhooks has been changed to follow this pattern: `https://{app}/runtime/webhooks/{triggerName}`.

### Locally developed application versions

You can make the following updates to function apps to locally change the targeted versions.

#### Visual Studio runtime versions

In Visual Studio, you select the runtime version when you create a project. Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio supports the three major runtime versions. The correct version is used when debugging and publishing based on project settings. The version settings are defined in the `.csproj` file in the following properties:

# [Version 4.x](#tab/v4)

```xml
<TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
```

You can also choose `net6.0`, `net7.0`, or `net48` as the target framework if you are using [.NET isolated process functions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md). Support for `net7.0` and `net48` is currently in preview.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Functions 4.x requires the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions` extension be at least `4.0.0`.

# [Version 3.x](#tab/v3)

```xml
<TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v3</AzureFunctionsVersion>
```

You can also choose `net5.0` as the target framework if you're using [.NET isolated process functions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Functions 3.x and .NET requires the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions` extension be at least `3.0.0`.

# [Version 2.x](#tab/v2)

```xml
<TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v2</AzureFunctionsVersion>
```

# [Version 1.x](#tab/v1)

```xml
<TargetFramework>net472</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v1</AzureFunctionsVersion>
```

###### Updating 2.x apps to 3.x in Visual Studio

You can open an existing function targeting 2.x and move to 3.x by editing the `.csproj` file and updating the values above.  Visual Studio manages runtime versions automatically for you based on project metadata.  However, it's possible if you've never created a 3.x app before that Visual Studio doesn't yet have the templates and runtime for 3.x on your machine.  This issue may present itself with an error like "no Functions runtime available that matches the version specified in the project."  To fetch the latest templates and runtime, go through the experience to create a new function project.  When you get to the version and template select screen, wait for Visual Studio to complete fetching the latest templates. After the latest .NET Core 3 templates are available and displayed, you can run and debug any project configured for version 3.x.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Version 3.x functions can only be developed in Visual Studio if using Visual Studio version 16.4 or newer.

#### VS Code and Azure Functions Core Tools

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md) is used for command-line development and also by the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code. To develop against version 3.x, install version 3.x of the Core Tools. Version 2.x development requires version 2.x of the Core Tools, and so on. For more information, see [Install the Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

For Visual Studio Code development, you may also need to update the user setting for the `azureFunctions.projectRuntime` to match the version of the tools installed.  This setting also updates the templates and languages used during function app creation.  To create apps in `~3`, you update the `azureFunctions.projectRuntime` user setting to `~3`.

#### Maven and Java apps

You can migrate Java apps from version 2.x to 3.x by [installing the 3.x version of the core tools](functions-run-local.md#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) required to run locally.  After verifying that your app works correctly running locally on version 3.x, update the app's `POM.xml` file to modify the `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` setting to `~3`, as in the following example:

```xml
<configuration>
    <resourceGroup>${functionResourceGroup}</resourceGroup>
    <appName>${functionAppName}</appName>
    <region>${functionAppRegion}</region>
    <appSettings>
        <property>
            <name>WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE</name>
            <value>1</value>
        </property>
        <property>
            <name>FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION</name>
            <value>~3</value>
        </property>
    </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

## Bindings

Starting with version 2.x, the runtime uses a new [binding extensibility model](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/wiki/Binding-Extensions-Overview) that offers these advantages:

* Support for third-party binding extensions.

* Decoupling of runtime and bindings. This change allows binding extensions to be versioned and released independently. You can, for example, opt to upgrade to a version of an extension that relies on a newer version of an underlying SDK.

* A lighter execution environment, where only the bindings in use are known and loaded by the runtime.

Except for HTTP and timer triggers, all bindings must be explicitly added to the function app project, or registered in the portal. For more information, see [Register binding extensions](./functions-bindings-expressions-patterns.md).

The following table shows which bindings are supported in each runtime version.
