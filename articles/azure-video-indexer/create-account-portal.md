# Get started with Azure Video Indexer in Azure portal

This Quickstart walks you through the steps to get started with Azure Video Indexer. You'll create an Azure Video Indexer account and its accompanying resources by using the Azure portal.

To start using Azure Video Indexer, you'll need to create an Azure Video Indexer account. The account needs to be associated with a [Media Services][docs-ms] resource and a [managed identity][docs-uami]. The managed identity will need to have Contributor permissions role on the Media Services.

## Prerequisites

### Account types

Before creating a new account, review [Account types](accounts-overview.md).

### Azure level

* This user should be a member of your Azure subscription with either an **Owner** role, or both **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** roles. A user can be added twice, with two roles. Once with Contributor and once with user Access Administrator. For more information, see [View the access a user has to Azure resources](../role-based-access-control/check-access.md).
* Register the **EventGrid** resource provider using the Azure portal.
    
    In the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com), go to **Subscriptions**->[<*subscription*>]->**ResourceProviders**.
Search for **Microsoft.Media** and **Microsoft.EventGrid**. If not in the "Registered" state, select **Register**. It takes a couple of minutes to register. 

### Azure Video Indexer

* Owner<sup>*</sup> role assignment on the Subscription level.

    * Owner* role assignment on the related Azure Media Services (AMS)
    * Owner* role assignment on the related Managed Identity

<sup>*</sub>Or both **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** roles

    |**Media Services account name**|Select a Media Services that the new Azure Video Indexer account will use to process the videos. You can select an existing Media Services or you can create a new one. The Media Services must be in the same location you selected.|
    |**Managed identity**|Select an existing **user-assigned** managed identity or **system-assigned** managed identity or both when creating the account. The new Azure Video Indexer account will use the selected managed identity to access the Media Services associated with the account.

A Contributor role should be assigned on the Media Services.|
