# Switch to Azure Monitor based alerts for Azure Backup

Azure Backup now provides new and improved alerting capabilities via Azure Monitor. If you're using the older [classic alerts solution](backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor.md?tabs=recovery-services-vaults#backup-alerts-in-recovery-services-vault) for Recovery Services vaults, we recommend you move to Azure Monitor alerts.

## Key benefits of Azure Monitor alerts

- **Configure notifications to a wide range of notification channels**: Azure Monitor supports a wide range of notification channels, such as email, ITSM, webhooks, logic apps, and so on. You can configure notifications for backup alerts to any of these channels without investing much time in creating custom integrations.

- **Enable notifications for selective scenarios**: With Azure Monitor alerts, you can choose the scenarios to be notified about. Also, you can enable notifications for test subscriptions.

- **Monitor alerts at-scale via Backup center**: In addition to enabling you to manage the alerts from Azure Monitor dashboard, Azure Backup also provides an alert management experience tailored to backups via Backup center. This allows you to filter alerts by backup specific properties, such as workload type, vault location, and so on, and a way to get quick visibility into the active backup security alerts that need attention.

- **Manage alerts and notifications programmatically**: You can use Azure Monitorâ€™s REST APIs to manage alerts and notifications via non-portal clients as well.

- **Consistent alert management for multiple Azure services, including backup**: Azure Monitor is the native service for monitoring resources across Azure. With the integration of Azure Backup with Azure Monitor, you can manage backup alerts in the same way as alerts for other Azure services, without requiring a separate learning curve.

## Supported alerting solutions

Azure Backup now supports different kinds of Azure Monitor based alerting solutions. You can use a combination of any of these based on your specific requirements. Some of these solutions are:

- **Built-in Azure Monitor alerts**: Azure Backup automatically generates built-in alerts for certain default scenarios, such as deletion of backup data, disabling of soft-delete, backup failures, restore failures, and so on. You can view these alerts out of the box via Backup center. To configure notifications for these alerts (for example, emails), you can use Azure Monitor's *Alert Processing Rules* and Action groups to route alerts to a wide range of notification channels.
- **Metric alerts**: You can write custom alert rules using Azure Monitor metrics to monitor the health of your backup items across different KPIs.
- **Log Alerts**: If you've scenarios where an alert needs to be generated based on custom logic, you can use Log Analytics based alerts for such scenarios, provided you've configured your vaults to send diagnostics data to a Log Analytics (LA) workspace.

## Migrate from classic alerts to built-in Azure Monitor alerts

Among the different Azure Monitor based alert solutions, built-in Azure Monitor alerts come closest to classic alerts as per user experience and functionality. So, to quickly switch from classic alerts to Azure Monitor, you can use built-in Azure Monitor alerts.

The following table lists the differences between classic backup alerts and built-in Azure Monitor alerts for backup:

| Actions | Classic alerts | Built-in Azure Monitor alerts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Setting up notifications** | - You must enable the configure notifications feature for each Recovery Services vault, along with the email id(s) to which the notifications should be sent. <br><br> - For certain destructive operations, email notifications are sent to the subscription owner, admin and co-admin irrespective of the notification settings of the vault.| - Notifications are configured by creating an alert processing rule. <br><br> - While *alerts* are generated by default and can't be turned off for destructive operations, the notifications are in the control of the user, allowing you to clearly specify which set of email address (or other notification endpoints) you wish to route alerts to. |
| **Notification suppression for database backup scenarios** | When there are multiple failures for the same database due to the same error code, a single alert is generated (with the occurrence count updated for each failure type) and a new alert is only generated when the original alert is inactivated. | The behavior is currently different. Here, a separate alert is generated for every backup failure. If there's a window of time when backups will fail for a certain known item (for example, during a maintenance window), you can create a suppression rule to suppress email noise for that backup item during the given period. |
| **Pricing** | There're no additional charges for this solution. | Alerts for critical operations/failures generate by default (that you can view in the Azure portal or via non-portal interfaces) at no additional charge. However, to route these alerts to a notification channel (such as email), it incurs a minor charge for notifications beyond the *free tier* (of 1000 emails per month). Learn more about [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/). |

Azure Backup now provides a guided experience via Backup center that allows you to switch to built-in Azure Monitor alerts and notifications with just a few selects.

Follow these steps:

1. On the Azure portal, go to **Backup center** -> **Overview**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/backup-center-overview-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Overview tab in Backup center." lightbox="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/backup-center-overview-expanded.png":::

1. On the **Alerts** tile, the count of vaults appears that still has the classic alerts enabled.

   Select the link to take the required action.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/backup-center-alerts-link-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing number of vaults which have classic alerts enabled." lightbox="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/backup-center-alerts-link-expanded.png":::

   On the next screen, there're two recommended actions:

   - **Create rule**: This action creates an alert processing rule attached to an action group to enable you to receive notifications for Azure Monitor alerts. After selecting, it leads you to a template deployment experience.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/recommended-action-one.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing recommended alert migration action Create rule for Recovery Services vaults.":::

     You can deploy two resources via this template:

   - **Alert Processing Rule**: A rule that specifies alert types to be routed to each notification channel. This template deploys alert processing rules that span all Azure Monitor based alerts on all Recovery Services vaults in the subscription that the rule is created in.
   - **Action Group**: The notification channel to which alerts should be sent. This template deploys an email action group so that alerts are routed to the email ID(s) specified while deploying the template.

   To modify any of these parameters, for example, scope of alert processing rule, or choice of notification channels, you can edit these resources after creation, or you can [create the alert processing rule and action group from scratch](backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor.md?tabs=recovery-services-vaults#configuring-notifications-for-alerts) via the Azure portal.

1. Enter the subscription, resource group, and region in which the alert processing rule and action group should be created. Also specify the email ID(s) to which notifications should be sent. Other parameters populate with default values and only need to be edited, if you want to customize the names and descriptions that the resources are created in.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-parameters.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing template parameters to setup notification rules for Azure Monitor alerts.":::

1. Select **Review+Create** to initiate deployment.

   Once deployed, notifications for Azure Monitor based alerts are enabled. If you have multiple subscriptions, repeat the above process to create an alert processing rule for each subscription.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-deploy.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing deployment of notification rules for Azure Monitor alerts.":::

1. Next, you need to opt-out of classic alerts to avoid receiving duplicate alerts from two solutions.

   Select **Manage Alerts** to view the vaults for which classic alerts are currently enabled.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/recommended-action-two.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing recommended alert migration action Manage Alerts for Recovery Services vaults.":::

1. Select **Update** -> **Use only Azure Monitor alerts** checkbox.

   By doing so, you agree to receive backup alerts only via Azure Monitor, and you'll stop receiving alerts from the older (classic alerts) solution.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/classic-alerts-vault.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to opt out of classic alerts for vault.":::

1. To select multiple vaults on a page and update the settings for these vaults with a single action, select **Update** from the top menu.

## Suppress notifications during a planned maintenance window

For certain scenarios, you might want to suppress notifications for a particular window of time when backups are going to fail. This is especially important for database backups, where log backups could happen as frequently as every 15 minutes, and you don't want to receive a separate notification every 15 minutes for each failure occurrence. In such a scenario, you can create a second alert processing rule that exists alongside the main alert processing rule used for sending notifications. The second alert processing rule won't be linked to an action group, but is used to specify the time for notification types tha notification should be suppressed.

By default, the suppression alert processing rule takes priority over the other alert processing rule. If a single fired alert is affected by different alert processing rules of both types, the action groups of that alert will be suppressed.

To create a suppression alert processing rule, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Backup center** -> **Alerts**, and select **Alert processing rules**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-blade.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing alert processing rules blade in portal.":::

1. Select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing creation of new alert processing rule.":::

1. Select **Scope**, for example, subscription or resource group, that the alert processing rule should span.

   You can also select more granular filters if you want to suppress notifications only for a particular backup item. For example, if you want to suppress notifications for *testdb1* database within Virtual Machine *VM1*, you can specify filters "where Alert Context (payload) contains /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000000/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/VM1/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/backupProtectedItem/SQLDataBase;MSSQLSERVER;testdb1".
   
   To get the required format of your required backup item, see the *SourceId field* from the [Alert details page](backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor.md?tabs=recovery-services-vaults#viewing-fired-alerts-in-the-azure-portal).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing specified scope of alert processing rule.":::

1. Under **Rule Settings**, select **Suppress notifications**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing alert processing rule settings.":::

1. Under **Scheduling**, select the window of time for which the alert processing rule will apply.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-schedule.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing alert processing rules scheduling.":::

1. Under **Details**, specify the subscription, resource group, and name under that the alert processing rule should be created.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/move-to-azure-monitor-alerts/alert-processing-rule-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing alert processing rules details.":::

1. Select **Review+Create**.

   If your suppression windows are one-off scenarios and not recurring, you can **Disable** the alert processing rule once you don't need it anymore. You can enable it again in future when you have a new maintenance window in the future.

## Programmatic options

You can also use programmatic methods to opt-out of classic alerts and manage Azure Monitor notifications.

- **Opting out of classic backup alerts**: The **monitoringSettings** vault property helps you specify whether you want to disable classic alerts. You can create a custom ARM/Bicep template or Azure Policy to modify this setting for your vaults. Below is an example of this property for a vault where classic alerts are disabled and built-in Azure Monitor alerts are enabled for all job failures.

   ```json
   {
      "monitoringSettings": {
         "classicAlertsForCriticalOperations": "Disabled",
         "azureMonitorAlertSettings": {
            "alertsForAllJobFailures": "Enabled"
         }
      }
   }
   ```

- **Setting up notifications for Azure Monitor alerts**:

You can use the following standard programmatic interfaces supported by Azure Monitor to manage action groups and alert processing rules.

- [Azure Monitor REST API reference](/rest/api/monitor/)
- [Azure Monitor PowerShell reference](/powershell/module/az.monitor/?view=azps-8.0.0&preserve-view=true)
- [Azure Monitor CLI reference](/cli/azure/monitor?view=azure-cli-latest)
