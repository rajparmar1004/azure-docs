# MLflow and Azure Machine Learning

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](../../includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Azure Machine Learning developer platform you are using:"]
> * [v1](v1/concept-mlflow-v1.md)
> * [v2 (current version)](concept-mlflow.md)

[MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org) is an open-source framework, designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle. Its ability to train and serve models on different platforms allows you to use a consistent set of tools regardless of where your experiments are running: locally on your computer, on a remote compute target, a virtual machine or an Azure Machine Learning compute instance.

> [!TIP]
> Azure Machine Learning workspaces are MLflow compatible, meaning that you can use Azure Machine Learning workspaces in the same way you use an MLflow Tracking Server. Such compatibility has the following advantages:
> * You can use Azure Machine Learning workspaces as your tracking server for any experiment you are running with MLflow, regardless if they run on Azure Machine Learning or not. You only need to configure MLflow to point to the workspace where the tracking should happen.
> * You can run any training routine that uses MLflow in Azure Machine Learning without changes. Model mangagement and model deployment capabilities are also supported.

MLflow can manage the complete machine learning lifecycle using four core capabilities:

* [Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html#using-the-tracking-api) is a component of MLflow that logs and tracks your training job metrics, parameters and model artifacts; no matter your experiment's environment--locally on your computer, on a remote compute target, a virtual machine or an Azure Machine Learning compute instance.
* [Model Registries](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html) is a component of MLflow that manage model's versions in a centralized repository.
* [Model Deployments](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#deploy-a-python-function-model-on-microsoft-azure-ml) is a component of MLflow that deploys models registered using the MLflow format to different compute targets. Because of how MLflow models are stored, there's no need to provide scoring scripts for models in such format.
* [Projects](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) is a format for packaging data science code in a reusable and reproducible way, based primarily on conventions. It's supported on preview on Azure Machine Learning.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike the Azure Machine Learning SDK v1, there's no logging functionality in the SDK v2 (preview), and it is recommended to use MLflow for logging and tracking.

## Tracking with MLflow

With MLflow Tracking you can connect Azure Machine Learning as the backend of your MLflow experiments. By doing so, you can:

+ Track and log experiment metrics and artifacts in your [Azure Machine Learning workspace](./concept-azure-machine-learning-v2.md#workspace).
  + If you're using Azure Machine Learning computes, they're already configured to work with MLflow for tracking. You don't need to configure the MLflow tracking URI to start working with them. Just import `mlflow` in your training routine and start using it
  + Azure Machine Learning also supports remote tracking of experiments by configuring MLflow to point to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. By doing so, you can leverage the capabilities of Azure Machine Learning while keeping your experiments where they are.
+ Lift and shift existing MLflow experiments to Azure Machine Learning. The workspace provides a centralized, secure, and scalable location to store training metrics and models.

Azure Machine Learning uses MLflow Tracking for metric logging and artifact storage for your experiments, whether you created the experiment via the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, Azure Machine Learning CLI or the Azure Machine Learning studio. Learn more at [Log & view metrics and log files with MLflow](how-to-log-view-metrics.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - MLflow in R support is limited to tracking experiment's metrics and parameters on Azure Machine Learning jobs. RStudio or Jupyter Notebooks with R kernels are not supported. View the following [R example about using the MLflow tracking client with Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/jobs/single-step/r).
> - MLflow in Java support is limited to tracking experiment's metrics and parameters on Azure Machine Learning jobs. View the following [Java example about using the MLflow tracking client with the Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/jobs/single-step/java/iris).

## Model Registries with MLflow

Azure Machine Learning supports MLflow for model management. This represents a convenient way to support the entire model lifecycle for users familiar with the MLFlow client.

To learn more about how you can manage models using the MLflow API in Azure Machine Learning, view [Manage models registries in Azure Machine Learning with MLflow](how-to-manage-models-mlflow.md).

## Model Deployments of MLflow models

You can [deploy MLflow models to Azure Machine Learning](how-to-deploy-mlflow-models.md), so you can leverage and apply Azure Machine Learning's model management capabilities and no-code deployment offering. We support deploying MLflow models to both real-time and batch endpoints. You can use the `azureml-mlflow` MLflow plugin, the Azure ML CLI v2, and using the user interface in Azure Machine Learning studio.

Learn more at [Deploy MLflow models to Azure Machine Learning](how-to-deploy-mlflow-models.md).

## Train MLflow projects (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview disclaimer](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

You can submit training jobs to Azure Machine Learning using [MLflow Projects](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) (preview). You can submit jobs locally with Azure Machine Learning tracking or migrate your jobs to the cloud like via an [Azure Machine Learning Compute](./how-to-create-attach-compute-cluster.md).
