In this article, you learn how to train computer vision models on image data with automated ML with the Azure Machine Learning CLI extension v2 or the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK v2 (preview).

Automated ML supports model training for computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Authoring AutoML models for computer vision tasks is currently supported via the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK. The resulting experimentation runs, models, and outputs are accessible from the Azure Machine Learning studio UI. [Learn more about automated ml for computer vision tasks on image data](concept-automated-ml.md).

## Prerequisites

## Select your task type

Automated ML for images supports the following task types:

Task type | AutoML Job syntax
---|---
 image classification | CLI v2: `image_classification` <br> SDK v2: `image_classification()`
image classification multi-label | CLI v2: `image_classification_multilabel` <br> SDK v2: `image_classification_multilabel()`
image object detection | CLI v2: `image_object_detection` <br> SDK v2: `image_object_detection()`
image instance segmentation| CLI v2: `image_instance_segmentation` <br> SDK v2: `image_instance_segmentation()`

# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

This task type is a required parameter and can be set using the `task` key.

For example:

```yaml
task: image_object_detection
```

# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)
Based on the task type, you can create automl image jobs using task specific `automl` functions.

For example:

```python
from azure.ai.ml import automl
image_object_detection_job = automl.image_object_detection()
```
---

## Training and validation data

In order to generate computer vision models, you need to bring labeled image data as input for model training in the form of an `MLTable`. You can create an `MLTable` from training data in JSONL format.

If your training data is in a different format (like, pascal VOC or COCO), you can apply the helper scripts included with the sample notebooks to convert the data to JSONL. Learn more about how to [prepare data for computer vision tasks with automated ML](how-to-prepare-datasets-for-automl-images.md). 

> [!Note]
> The training data needs to have at least 10 images in order to be able to submit an AutoML run. 

> [!Warning]
> Creation of `MLTable` is only supported using the SDK and CLI to create from data in JSONL format for this capability. Creating the `MLTable` via UI is not supported at this time.


### JSONL schema samples

The structure of the TabularDataset depends upon the task at hand. For computer vision task types, it consists of the following fields:

Field| Description
---|---
`image_url`| Contains filepath as a StreamInfo object
`image_details`|Image metadata information consists of height, width, and format. This field is optional and hence may or may not exist.
`label`| A json representation of the image label, based on the task type.

The following is a sample JSONL file for image classification:

```python
{
      "image_url": "AmlDatastore://image_data/Image_01.png",
      "image_details":
      {
          "format": "png",
          "width": "2230px",
          "height": "4356px"
      },
      "label": "cat"
  }
  {
      "image_url": "AmlDatastore://image_data/Image_02.jpeg",
      "image_details":
      {
          "format": "jpeg",
          "width": "3456px",
          "height": "3467px"
      },
      "label": "dog"
  }
  ```

  The following code is a sample JSONL file for object detection:

  ```python
  {
      "image_url": "AmlDatastore://image_data/Image_01.png",
      "image_details":
      {
          "format": "png",
          "width": "2230px",
          "height": "4356px"
      },
      "label":
      {
          "label": "cat",
          "topX": "1",
          "topY": "0",
          "bottomX": "0",
          "bottomY": "1",
          "isCrowd": "true",
      }
  }
  {
      "image_url": "AmlDatastore://image_data/Image_02.png",
      "image_details":
      {
          "format": "jpeg",
          "width": "1230px",
          "height": "2356px"
      },
      "label":
      {
          "label": "dog",
          "topX": "0",
          "topY": "1",
          "bottomX": "0",
          "bottomY": "1",
          "isCrowd": "false",
      }
  }
  ```


### Consume data

Once your data is in JSONL format, you can create training and validation `MLTable` as shown below.

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/jobs/automl-standalone-jobs/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items/data/training-mltable-folder/MLTable":::

Automated ML doesn't impose any constraints on training or validation data size for computer vision tasks. Maximum dataset size is only limited by the storage layer behind the dataset (i.e. blob store). There's no minimum number of images or labels. However, we recommend starting with a minimum of 10-15 samples per label to ensure the output model is sufficiently trained. The higher the total number of labels/classes, the more samples you need per label.

# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

Training data is a required parameter and is passed in using the `training` key of the data section. You can optionally specify another MLtable as a validation data with the `validation` key. If no validation data is specified, 20% of your training data will be used for validation by default, unless you pass `validation_data_size` argument with a different value.

Target column name is a required parameter and used as target for supervised ML task. It's passed in using the `target_column_name` key in the data section. For example,

```yaml
target_column_name: label
training_data:
  path: data/training-mltable-folder
  type: mltable
validation_data:
  path: data/validation-mltable-folder
  type: mltable
```

# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)

You can create data inputs from training and validation MLTable from your local directory or cloud storage with the following code:

[!Notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/jobs/automl-standalone-jobs/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items.ipynb?name=data-load)]

Training data is a required parameter and is passed in using the `training_data` parameter of the task specific `automl` type function. You can optionally specify another MLTable as a validation data with the `validation_data` parameter. If no validation data is specified, 20% of your training data will be used for validation by default, unless you pass `validation_data_size` argument with a different value.

Target column name is a required parameter and used as target for supervised ML task. It's passed in using the `target_column_name` parameter of the task specific `automl` function. For example,

```python
from azure.ai.ml import automl
image_object_detection_job = automl.image_object_detection(
    training_data=my_training_data_input,
    validation_data=my_validation_data_input,
    target_column_name="label"
)
```
---

## Compute to run experiment

Provide a [compute target](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md#compute-targets) for automated ML to conduct model training. Automated ML models for computer vision tasks require GPU SKUs and support NC and ND families. We recommend the NCsv3-series (with v100 GPUs) for faster training. A compute target with a multi-GPU VM SKU leverages multiple GPUs to also speed up training. Additionally, when you set up a compute target with multiple nodes you can conduct faster model training through parallelism when tuning hyperparameters for your model.

The compute target is passed in using the `compute` parameter. For example:

# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```yaml
compute: azureml:gpu-cluster
```

# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)

```python
from azure.ai.ml import automl

compute_name = "gpu-cluster"
image_object_detection_job = automl.image_object_detection(
    compute=compute_name,
)
```
---

## Configure model algorithms and hyperparameters

With support for computer vision tasks, you can control the model algorithm and sweep hyperparameters. These model algorithms and hyperparameters are passed in as the parameter space for the sweep.

The model algorithm is required and is passed in via `model_name` parameter. You can either specify a single `model_name` or choose between multiple. 

### Supported model algorithms

The following table summarizes the supported models for each computer vision task.

Task |  Model algorithms | String literal syntax<br> ***`default_model`\**** denoted with \*
---|----------|----------
Image classification<br> (multi-class and multi-label)| **MobileNet**: Light-weighted models for mobile applications <br> **ResNet**: Residual networks<br> **ResNeSt**: Split attention networks<br> **SE-ResNeXt50**: Squeeze-and-Excitation networks<br> **ViT**: Vision transformer networks| `mobilenetv2`   <br>`resnet18` <br>`resnet34` <br> `resnet50`  <br> `resnet101` <br> `resnet152`    <br> `resnest50` <br> `resnest101`  <br> `seresnext`  <br> `vits16r224` (small) <br> ***`vitb16r224`\**** (base) <br>`vitl16r224` (large)|
Object detection | **YOLOv5**: One stage object detection model   <br>  **Faster RCNN ResNet FPN**: Two stage object detection models  <br> **RetinaNet ResNet FPN**: address class imbalance with Focal Loss <br> <br>*Note: Refer to [`model_size` hyperparameter](reference-automl-images-hyperparameters.md#model-specific-hyperparameters) for YOLOv5 model sizes.*| ***`yolov5`\**** <br> `fasterrcnn_resnet18_fpn` <br> `fasterrcnn_resnet34_fpn` <br> `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn` <br> `fasterrcnn_resnet101_fpn` <br> `fasterrcnn_resnet152_fpn` <br> `retinanet_resnet50_fpn` 
Instance segmentation | **MaskRCNN ResNet FPN**| `maskrcnn_resnet18_fpn` <br> `maskrcnn_resnet34_fpn` <br> ***`maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn`\****  <br> `maskrcnn_resnet101_fpn` <br> `maskrcnn_resnet152_fpn`


In addition to controlling the model algorithm, you can also tune hyperparameters used for model training. While many of the hyperparameters exposed are model-agnostic, there are instances where hyperparameters are task-specific or model-specific. [Learn more about the available hyperparameters for these instances](reference-automl-images-hyperparameters.md). 

### Data augmentation 

In general, deep learning model performance can often improve with more data. Data augmentation is a practical technique to amplify the data size and variability of a dataset which helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model’s generalization ability on unseen data. Automated ML applies different data augmentation techniques based on the computer vision task, before feeding input images to the model. Currently, there is no exposed hyperparameter to control data augmentations. 

|Task | Impacted dataset | Data augmentation technique(s) applied |
|-------|----------|---------|
|Image classification (multi-class and multi-label) | Training <br><br><br> Validation & Test| Random resize and crop, horizontal flip, color jitter (brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue), normalization using channel-wise ImageNet’s mean and standard deviation <br><br><br>Resize, center crop, normalization |
|Object detection, instance segmentation| Training <br><br> Validation & Test |Random crop around bounding boxes, expand, horizontal flip, normalization, resize <br><br><br>Normalization, resize
|Object detection using yolov5| Training <br><br> Validation & Test  |Mosaic, random affine (rotation, translation, scale, shear), horizontal flip <br><br><br> Letterbox resizing|

## Configure your experiment settings

Before doing a large sweep to search for the optimal models and hyperparameters, we recommend trying the default values to get a first baseline. Next, you can explore multiple hyperparameters for the same model before sweeping over multiple models and their parameters. This way, you can employ a more iterative approach, because with multiple models and multiple hyperparameters for each, the search space grows exponentially and you need more iterations to find optimal configurations.

# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

If you wish to use the default hyperparameter values for a given algorithm (say yolov5), you can specify it using model_name key in image_model section. For example,

```yaml
image_model:
    model_name: "yolov5"
```
# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)

If you wish to use the default hyperparameter values for a given algorithm (say yolov5), you can specify it using model_name parameter in  set_image_model method of the task specific `automl` job. For example,

```python
image_object_detection_job.set_image_model(model_name="yolov5")
```
---
Once you've built a baseline model, you might want to optimize model performance in order to sweep over the model algorithm and hyperparameter space. You can use the following sample config to sweep over the hyperparameters for each algorithm, choosing from a range of values for learning_rate, optimizer, lr_scheduler, etc., to generate a model with the optimal primary metric. If hyperparameter values are not specified, then default values are used for the specified algorithm.

### Primary metric

The primary metric used for model optimization and hyperparameter tuning depends on the task type. Using other primary metric values is currently not supported. 

* `accuracy` for IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION
* `iou` for IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION_MULTILABEL
* `mean_average_precision` for IMAGE_OBJECT_DETECTION
* `mean_average_precision` for IMAGE_INSTANCE_SEGMENTATION
    
### Experiment budget

You can optionally specify the maximum time budget for your AutoML Vision training job using the `timeout` parameter in the `limits` - the amount of time in minutes before the experiment terminates. If none specified, default experiment timeout is seven days (maximum 60 days). For example,
# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```yaml
limits:
  timeout: 60
```

# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)

[!Notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/jobs/automl-standalone-jobs/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items.ipynb?name=limit-settings)]

---

## Sweeping hyperparameters for your model

When training computer vision models, model performance depends heavily on the hyperparameter values selected. Often, you might want to tune the hyperparameters to get optimal performance.
With support for computer vision tasks in automated ML, you can sweep hyperparameters to find the optimal settings for your model. This feature applies the hyperparameter tuning capabilities in Azure Machine Learning. [Learn how to tune hyperparameters](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md).

### Define the parameter search space

You can define the model algorithms and hyperparameters to sweep in the parameter space. 

* See [Configure model algorithms and hyperparameters](#configure-model-algorithms-and-hyperparameters) for the list of supported model algorithms for each task type. 
* See [Hyperparameters for computer vision tasks](reference-automl-images-hyperparameters.md)  hyperparameters for each computer vision task type. 
* See [details on supported distributions for discrete and continuous hyperparameters](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#define-the-search-space).

### Sampling methods for the sweep

When sweeping hyperparameters, you need to specify the sampling method to use for sweeping over the defined parameter space. Currently, the following sampling methods are supported with the `sampling_algorithm` parameter:

| Sampling type | AutoML Job syntax |
|-------|---------|
|[Random Sampling](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#random-sampling)| `random` |
|[Grid Sampling](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#grid-sampling)| `grid` |
|[Bayesian Sampling](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#bayesian-sampling)| `bayesian` |
    
> [!NOTE]
> Currently only random sampling supports conditional hyperparameter spaces.

### Early termination policies

You can automatically end poorly performing runs with an early termination policy. Early termination improves computational efficiency, saving compute resources that would have been otherwise spent on less promising configurations. Automated ML for images supports the following early termination policies using the `early_termination` parameter. If no termination policy is specified, all configurations are run to completion.


| Early termination policy | AutoML Job syntax |
|-------|---------|
|[Bandit policy](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#bandit-policy)| CLI v2: `bandit` <br> SDK v2: `BanditPolicy()` |
|[Median stopping policy](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#median-stopping-policy)| CLI v2: `median_stopping` <br> SDK v2: `MedianStoppingPolicy()` |
|[Truncation selection policy](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#truncation-selection-policy)| CLI v2: `truncation_selection` <br> SDK v2: `TruncationSelectionPolicy()` |

Learn more about [how to configure the early termination policy for your hyperparameter sweep](how-to-tune-hyperparameters.md#early-termination).

### Resources for the sweep

You can control the resources spent on your hyperparameter sweep by specifying the `max_trials` and the `max_concurrent_trials` for the sweep.
> [!NOTE]
> For a complete sweep configuration sample, please refer to this [tutorial](tutorial-auto-train-image-models.md#hyperparameter-sweeping-for-image-tasks).

Parameter | Detail
-----|----
`max_trials` |  Required parameter for maximum number of configurations to sweep. Must be an integer between 1 and 1000. When exploring just the default hyperparameters for a given model algorithm, set this parameter to 1.
`max_concurrent_trials`| Maximum number of runs that can run concurrently. If not specified, all runs launch in parallel. If specified, must be an integer between 1 and 100.  <br><br> **NOTE:** The number of concurrent runs is gated on the resources available in the specified compute target. Ensure that the compute target has the available resources for the desired concurrency.

You can configure all the sweep related parameters as shown in the example below.

# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```yaml
sweep:
  limits:
    max_trials: 10
    max_concurrent_trials: 2
  sampling_algorithm: random
  early_termination:
    type: bandit
    evaluation_interval: 2
    slack_factor: 0.2
    delay_evaluation: 6
```

# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)

[!Notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/jobs/automl-standalone-jobs/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items.ipynb?name=sweep-settings)]

---


### Fixed settings

You can pass fixed settings or parameters that don't change during the parameter space sweep as shown below.

# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```yaml
image_model:
  early_stopping: True
  evaluation_frequency: 1
```


# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)
 
[!Notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/jobs/automl-standalone-jobs/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items.ipynb?name=pass-arguments)]


---

##  Incremental training (optional)

Once the training run is done, you have the option to further train the model by loading the trained model checkpoint. You can either use the same dataset or a different one for incremental training. 


### Pass the checkpoint via run ID

You can pass the run ID that you want to load the checkpoint from.

# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

```yaml
image_model:
  checkpoint_run_id : "target_checkpoint_run_id"
```


# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)

To find the run ID from the desired model, you can use the following code. 

```python
# find a run id to get a model checkpoint from
import mlflow

# Obtain the tracking URL from MLClient
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI = ml_client.workspaces.get(
    name=ml_client.workspace_name
).mlflow_tracking_uri
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI)

from mlflow.tracking.client import MlflowClient

mlflow_client = MlflowClient()
mlflow_parent_run = mlflow_client.get_run(automl_job.name)

# Fetch the id of the best automl child run.
target_checkpoint_run_id = mlflow_parent_run.data.tags["automl_best_child_run_id"]
```

To pass a checkpoint via the run ID, you need to use the `checkpoint_run_id` parameter in `set_image_model` function.

```python
image_object_detection_job = automl.image_object_detection(
    compute=compute_name,
    experiment_name=exp_name,
    training_data=my_training_data_input,
    validation_data=my_validation_data_input,
    target_column_name="label",
    primary_metric="mean_average_precision",
    tags={"my_custom_tag": "My custom value"},
)

image_object_detection_job.set_image_model(checkpoint_run_id=target_checkpoint_run_id)

automl_image_job_incremental = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
    image_object_detection_job
) 
```

---


## Submit the AutoML job



# [CLI v2](#tab/CLI-v2)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](../../includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

To submit your AutoML job, you run the following CLI v2 command with the path to your .yml file, workspace name, resource group and subscription ID.

```azurecli
az ml job create --file ./hello-automl-job-basic.yml --workspace-name [YOUR_AZURE_WORKSPACE] --resource-group [YOUR_AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP] --subscription [YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION]
```

# [Python SDK v2 (preview)](#tab/SDK-v2)

When you've configured your AutoML Job to the desired settings, you can submit the job.

[!Notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-main/sdk/jobs/automl-standalone-jobs/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items/automl-image-object-detection-task-fridge-items.ipynb?name=submit-run)]
---

## Outputs and evaluation metrics

The automated ML training runs generates output model files, evaluation metrics, logs and deployment artifacts like the scoring file and the environment file which can be viewed from the outputs and logs and metrics tab of the child runs.

> [!TIP]
> Check how to navigate to the run results from the  [View run results](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md#view-run-results) section.

For definitions and examples of the performance charts and metrics provided for each run, see [Evaluate automated machine learning experiment results](how-to-understand-automated-ml.md#metrics-for-image-models-preview)

## Register and deploy model

Once the run completes, you can register the model that was created from the best run (configuration that resulted in the best primary metric).

You can deploy the model from the [Azure Machine Learning studio UI](https://ml.azure.com/). 
Navigate to the model you wish to deploy in the **Models** tab of the automated ML run and select the **Deploy**.  

![Select model from the automl runs in studio UI  ](./media/how-to-auto-train-image-models/select-model.png)

You can configure the model deployment endpoint name and the inferencing cluster to use for your model deployment in the **Deploy a model** pane.
