# How to troubleshoot a VM
On rare occasions, you may have problems connecting with a VM in one of your labs. There are some troubleshooting steps you can take as a student to resolve connectivity issues and get back up and running quickly. You can avoid having to escalate the issue to your educator and wait for a solution.

## Reset VMs

To reset one or more VMs, select them in the list, and then select **Reset** on the toolbar.

On the **Reset virtual machine(s)** dialog box, select **Reset**.

### Redeploy VMs

In the [April 2022 Update (preview)](lab-services-whats-new.md), redeploying VMs replaces the previous reset VM behavior.  In the Lab Services web portal: [https://labs.azure.com](https://labs.azure.com), the command is named **Troubleshoot** and is available in the student's view of their VMs.

If you're facing difficulties accessing their VM, redeploying the VM may provide a resolution for the issue. Redeploying, unlike resetting, doesn't cause the data on the OS to be lost.  When you [redeploy a VM](/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/redeploy-to-new-node-windows), Azure Lab Services will shut down the VM, move it to a new host, and restart it.  You can think of it as a refresh of the underlying VM for your machine.  You donâ€™t need to re-register to the lab or perform any other action.  Any data you saved in the OS disk (usually C: drive) of the VM will still be available after the redeploy operation.  Anything saved on the temporary disk (usually D: drive) will be lost.
