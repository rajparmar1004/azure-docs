# Use the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver in an AKS cluster

The Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver allows for the integration of an Azure key vault as a secrets store with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster via a [CSI volume][kube-csi].

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- Before you start, ensure that your version of the Azure CLI is 2.30.0 or later. If it's an earlier version, [install the latest version](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- If restricting Ingress to the cluster, ensure Ports 9808 and 8095 are open. 

### Supported Kubernetes versions

The minimum recommended Kubernetes version is based on the [rolling Kubernetes version support window][kubernetes-version-support]. Ensure that you're running version N-2 or later.

## Features

- Mounts secrets, keys, and certificates to a pod by using a CSI volume
- Supports CSI inline volumes
- Supports mounting multiple secrets store objects as a single volume
- Supports pod portability with the `SecretProviderClass` CRD
- Supports Windows containers
- Syncs with Kubernetes secrets
- Supports auto rotation of mounted contents and synced Kubernetes secrets

## Create an AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver support

First, create an Azure resource group:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create -n myResourceGroup -l eastus2
```

To create an AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver capability, use the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command with the `azure-keyvault-secrets-provider` add-on.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-managed-identity
```

A user-assigned managed identity, named `azurekeyvaultsecretsprovider-*`, is created by the add-on for the purpose of accessing Azure resources. The following example uses this identity to connect to the Azure key vault where the secrets will be stored, but you can also use other [identity access methods][identity-access-methods]. Take note of the identity's `clientId` in the output:

```json
...,
 "addonProfiles": {
    "azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider": {
      ...,
      "identity": {
        "clientId": "<client-id>",
        ...
      }
    }
```

## Upgrade an existing AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver support

To upgrade an existing AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver capability, use the [az aks enable-addons][az-aks-enable-addons] command with the `azure-keyvault-secrets-provider` add-on:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks enable-addons --addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

As mentioned in the preceding section, the add-on creates a user-assigned managed identity that you can use to authenticate to your Azure key vault.

## Verify the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver installation

The preceding command installs the Secrets Store CSI Driver and the Azure Key Vault Provider on your nodes. Verify that the installation is finished by listing all pods that have the `secrets-store-csi-driver` and `secrets-store-provider-azure` labels in the kube-system namespace, and ensure that your output looks similar to the output shown here:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l 'app in (secrets-store-csi-driver, secrets-store-provider-azure)'

NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
aks-secrets-store-csi-driver-4vpkj       3/3     Running   2          4m25s
aks-secrets-store-csi-driver-ctjq6       3/3     Running   2          4m21s
aks-secrets-store-csi-driver-tlvlq       3/3     Running   2          4m24s
aks-secrets-store-provider-azure-5p4nb   1/1     Running   0          4m21s
aks-secrets-store-provider-azure-6pqmv   1/1     Running   0          4m24s
aks-secrets-store-provider-azure-f5qlm   1/1     Running   0          4m25s
```

Be sure that a Secrets Store CSI Driver pod and a Secrets Store Provider Azure pod are running on each node in your cluster's node pools.

## Create or use an existing Azure key vault

In addition to an AKS cluster, you'll need an Azure key vault resource that stores the secret content. Keep in mind that the key vault's name must be globally unique.

```azurecli
az keyvault create -n <keyvault-name> -g myResourceGroup -l eastus2
```

Your Azure key vault can store keys, secrets, and certificates. In this example, you'll set a plain-text secret called `ExampleSecret`:

```azurecli
az keyvault secret set --vault-name <keyvault-name> -n ExampleSecret --value MyAKSExampleSecret
```

Take note of the following properties for use in the next section:

- The name of the secret object in the key vault
- The object type (secret, key, or certificate)
- The name of your Azure key vault resource
- The Azure tenant ID that the subscription belongs to

## Provide an identity to access the Azure key vault

The Secrets Store CSI Driver allows for the following methods to access an Azure key vault:
- An [Azure Active Directory pod identity][aad-pod-identity]
- A user-assigned or system-assigned managed identity

Follow the instructions in [Provide an identity to access the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver][identity-access-methods] for your chosen method.

## Validate the secrets

After the pod starts, the mounted content at the volume path that you specified in your deployment YAML is available.

```Bash
## show secrets held in secrets-store
kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-inline -- ls /mnt/secrets-store/

## print a test secret 'ExampleSecret' held in secrets-store
kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-inline -- cat /mnt/secrets-store/ExampleSecret
```

## Obtain certificates and keys

The Azure Key Vault design makes sharp distinctions between keys, secrets, and certificates. The Key Vault service’s certificates features were designed to make use of its key and secret capabilities. When a key vault certificate is created, an addressable key and secret are also created with the same name. The key allows key operations, and the secret allows the retrieval of the certificate value as a secret. 

A key vault certificate also contains public x509 certificate metadata. The key vault stores both the public and private components of your certificate in a secret. You can obtain each individual component by specifying the `objectType` in `SecretProviderClass`. The following table shows which objects map to the various resources associated with your certificate:

| Object | Return value | Returns entire certificate chain |
|---|---|---|
|`key`|The public key, in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format|N/A|
|`cert`|The certificate, in PEM format|No|
|`secret`|The private key and certificate, in PEM format|Yes|
| | |

## Disable the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver on an existing AKS cluster

> [!NOTE]
> Before you disable the add-on, ensure that no `SecretProviderClass` is in use. Trying to disable the add-on while `SecretProviderClass` exists will result in an error.

To disable the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver capability in an existing cluster, use the [az aks disable-addons][az-aks-disable-addons] command with the `azure-keyvault-secrets-provider` flag:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks disable-addons --addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the add-on is disabled, existing workloads will have no issues and will not see any updates in the mounted secrets. If the pod restarts or a new pod is created as part of scale-up event, the pod will fail to start because the driver is no longer running.

## Additional configuration options

### Enable and disable autorotation

> [!NOTE]
> When the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver is enabled, it updates the pod mount and the Kubernetes secret that's defined in the `secretObjects` field of `SecretProviderClass`. It does so by polling for changes periodically, based on the rotation poll interval you've defined. The default rotation poll interval is 2 minutes.

>[!NOTE]
> When a secret is updated in an external secrets store after initial pod deployment, the Kubernetes Secret and the pod mount will be periodically updated depending on how the application consumes the secret data.
>
> **Mount the Kubernetes Secret as a volume**: Use the auto rotation and Sync K8s secrets features of Secrets Store CSI Driver. The application will need to watch for changes from the mounted Kubernetes Secret volume. When the Kubernetes Secret is updated by the CSI Driver, the corresponding volume contents are automatically updated.
>
> **Application reads the data from the container’s filesystem**: Use the rotation feature of Secrets Store CSI Driver. The application will need to watch for the file change from the volume mounted by the CSI driver.
>
> **Use the Kubernetes Secret for an environment variable**: Restart the pod to get the latest secret as an environment variable.
> Use a tool such as [Reloader][reloader] to watch for changes on the synced Kubernetes Secret and perform rolling upgrades on pods.

To enable autorotation of secrets, use the `enable-secret-rotation` flag when you create your cluster:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -n myAKSCluster2 -g myResourceGroup --enable-addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-secret-rotation
```

Or update an existing cluster with the add-on enabled:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks addon update -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster2 -a azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-secret-rotation
```

To specify a custom rotation interval, use the `rotation-poll-interval` flag:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks addon update -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster2 -a azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-secret-rotation --rotation-poll-interval 5m
```

To disable autorotation, use the flag `disable-secret-rotation`:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks addon update -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster2 -a azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --disable-secret-rotation
```

### Sync mounted content with a Kubernetes secret

You might sometimes want to create a Kubernetes secret to mirror the mounted content.

When you create a `SecretProviderClass`, use the `secretObjects` field to define the desired state of the Kubernetes secret, as shown in the following example.

> [!NOTE]
> The YAML examples here are incomplete. You'll need to modify them to support your chosen method of access to your key vault identity. For details, see [Provide an identity to access the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver][identity-access-methods].

The secrets will sync only after you start a pod to mount them. To rely solely on syncing with the Kubernetes secrets feature doesn't work. When all the pods that consume the secret are deleted, the Kubernetes secret is also deleted.

```yml
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: azure-sync
spec:
  provider: azure                             
  secretObjects:                              # [OPTIONAL] SecretObjects defines the desired state of synced Kubernetes secret objects
  - data:
    - key: username                           # data field to populate
      objectName: foo1                        # name of the mounted content to sync; this could be the object name or the object alias
    secretName: foosecret                     # name of the Kubernetes secret object
    type: Opaque                              # type of Kubernetes secret object (for example, Opaque, kubernetes.io/tls)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that the `objectName` in the `secretObjects` field matches the file name of the mounted content. If you use `objectAlias` instead, it should match the object alias.

#### Set an environment variable to reference Kubernetes secrets

After you've created the Kubernetes secret, you can reference it by setting an environment variable in your pod, as shown in the following example code:

> [!NOTE]
> The example here demonstrates access to a secret through env variables and through volume/volumeMount. This is for illustrative purposes. These two methods can exist independently from the other.

```yml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: busybox-secrets-store-inline
spec:
  containers:
    - name: busybox
      image: k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/busybox:1.29-1
      command:
        - "/bin/sleep"
        - "10000"
      volumeMounts:
      - name: secrets-store01-inline
        mountPath: "/mnt/secrets-store"
        readOnly: true
      env:
      - name: SECRET_USERNAME
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: foosecret
            key: username
  volumes:
    - name: secrets-store01-inline
      csi:
        driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
        readOnly: true
        volumeAttributes:
          secretProviderClass: "azure-sync"
```
