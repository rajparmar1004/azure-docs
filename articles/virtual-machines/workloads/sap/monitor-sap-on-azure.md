# What is Azure Monitor for SAP solutions? (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Azure Monitor for SAP solutions public preview notice](./includes/preview-azure-monitor.md)]

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you'll want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes how to monitor SAP running on Azure using Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. Azure Monitor for SAP solutions uses specific parts of the [Azure Monitor](../../../azure-monitor/overview.md) infrastructure.

> [!NOTE]
> There are currently two versions of Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. Old one is Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) and new one is Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. This article will talk about both the versions. 

## Overview

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for anyone running their SAP landscapes on Azure. It works with both [SAP on Azure Virtual Machines](./hana-get-started.md) and [SAP on Azure Large Instances](./hana-overview-architecture.md).

With Azure Monitor for SAP solutions, you can collect telemetry data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one central location and visually correlate the data for faster troubleshooting.

You can monitor different components of an SAP landscape, such as Azure virtual machines (VMs), high-availability cluster, SAP HANA database, SAP NetWeaver, and so on, by adding the corresponding **provider** for that component. For more information, see [Deploy Azure Monitor for SAP solutions by using the Azure portal](azure-monitor-sap-quickstart.md).

The following table provides a quick comparison of the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) and Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. 

classic
| Azure Monitor for SAP solutions | Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Azure Functions-based collector architecture | VM-based collector architecture |
| Support for Microsoft SQL Server, SAP HANA, and IBM Db2 databases | Support for Microsoft SQL Server, and SAP HANA databases |

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions uses the [Azure Monitor](../../../azure-monitor/overview.md) capabilities of [Log Analytics](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md) and [Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). With it, you can:

- Create [custom visualizations](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) by editing the default Workbooks provided by Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. 
- Write [custom queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md).
- Create [custom alerts](../../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log.md) by using Azure Log Analytics workspace. 
- Take advantage of the [flexible retention period](../../../azure-monitor/logs/data-retention-archive.md) in Azure Monitor Logs/Log Analytics. 
- Connect monitoring data with your ticketing system.

## What data does Azure Monitor for SAP solutions collect?

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions doesn't collect Azure Monitor metrics or resource log data as does many other Azure resources. Instead, it sends custom logs directly to the Azure Monitor Logs system, where you can then use the built-in features of Log Analytics.

## Data sharing with Microsoft

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only applicable for Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) version.

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions collects system metadata to provide improved support for SAP on Azure. No PII/EUII is collected.

You can enable data sharing with Microsoft when you create Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource by choosing *Share* from the drop-down. We recommend that you enable data sharing. Data sharing gives Microsoft support and engineering teams information about your environment, which helps us provide better support for your mission-critical SAP on Azure solution.

## Architecture overview
> [!Note]
> This content would apply to both versions.

### Azure Monitor for SAP solutions

The following diagram shows, at a high level, how Azure Monitor for SAP solutions collects telemetry from the SAP HANA database. The architecture is the same whether SAP HANA is deployed on Azure VMs or Azure Large Instances.

![Diagram shows AMS New Architecture.](./media/azure-monitor-sap/azure-monitor-sap-solution-new-arch-2.png)  



The key components of the architecture are:

- The **Azure portal**, which is where you can access the marketplace and the AMS (classic) service.
- The **AMS (classic) resource**, where you can view monitoring telemetry.
- The **managed resource group**, which is deployed automatically as part of the AMS resource's deployment. The resources inside the managed resource group help to collect telemetry. Key resources include:
   - An **Azure Functions resource** that hosts the monitoring code, which is the logic that collects telemetry from the source systems and transfers the data to the monitoring framework. 
   - An **[Azure Key Vault resource](../../../key-vault/general/basic-concepts.md)**, which securely holds the SAP HANA database credentials and stores information about [providers](./azure-monitor-providers.md).
   - The **Log Analytics workspace**, which is the destination for storing telemetry data. Optionally, you can choose to use an existing workspace in the same subscription as your AMS resource at deployment.
   
   [Azure Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) provides customizable visualization of the telemetry in Log Analytics. To automatically refresh your workbooks or visualizations, pin the items to the Azure dashboard. The maximum refresh frequency is every 30 minutes.
   
   You can also use Kusto query language (KQL) to [run log queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md) against the raw tables inside the Log Analytics workspace. 


### Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) 

The following diagram shows, at a high level, how Azure Monitor for SAP solutions (classic) collects telemetry from the SAP HANA database. The architecture is the same whether SAP HANA is deployed on Azure VMs or Azure Large Instances.

![Azure Monitor for SAP solutions architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75772258/115046700-62ff3280-9ef5-11eb-8d0d-cfcda526aeeb.png)

The key components of the architecture are:
- **Azure portal** – Your starting point. You can navigate to marketplace within Azure portal and discover Azure Monitor for SAP solutions.
- **Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource** - A landing place for you to view monitoring telemetry.
- **Managed resource group** – Deployed automatically as part of the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions resource deployment. The resources deployed within managed resource group help with collection of telemetry. Key resources deployed and their purposes are:
   - **Azure virtual machine**: Also known as *collector VM*, it's a Standard_B2ms VM. The main purpose of this VM is to host the *monitoring payload*. Monitoring payload refers to the logic of collecting telemetry from the source systems and transferring the data to the monitoring framework. In the preceding diagram, the monitoring payload contains the logic to connect to SAP HANA database over SQL port.
   - **[Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/basic-concepts.md)**: This resource is deployed to securely hold SAP HANA database credentials and to store information about [providers](./azure-monitor-providers.md).
   - **Log Analytics Workspace**: The destination where the telemetry data is stored.
      - Visualization is built on top of telemetry in Log Analytics using [Azure Workbooks](../../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). You can customize visualization. You can also pin your Workbooks or specific visualization within Workbooks to Azure dashboard for autorefresh. The maximum frequency for refresh is every 30 minutes.
      - You can use your existing workspace within the same subscription as SAP monitor resource by choosing this option at deployment.
      - You can use Kusto query language (KQL) to run [queries](../../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md) against the raw tables inside Log Analytics workspace. Look at *Custom Logs*.

> [!Note]
> You are responsible for patching and maintaining the VM, deployed in the managed resource group.

> [!Tip]
> You can use an existing Log Analytics workspace for telemetry collection if it's deployed within the same Azure subscription as the resource for Azure Monitor for SAP solutions.

### Architecture highlights

Here are the key highlights of the architecture:
 - **Multi-instance** - You can monitor multiple instances of a given component type (for example, HANA database, high availability (HA) cluster, Microsoft SQL server, SAP NetWeaver) across multiple SAP SIDs within a VNET with a single resource of Azure Monitor for SAP solutions.
 - **Multi-provider** - The preceding architecture diagram shows the SAP HANA provider as an example. Similarly, you can configure more providers for corresponding components to collect data from those components. For example, HANA DB, HA cluster, Microsoft SQL server, and SAP NetWeaver. 
 
 - **Extensible query framework** - SQL queries to collect telemetry data are written in [JSON](https://github.com/Azure/AzureMonitorForSAPSolutions/blob/master/sapmon/content/SapHana.json). More SQL queries to collect more telemetry data can be easily added. You can request specific telemetry data to be added to Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. Do so by leaving feedback using the link at the end of this article. You can also leave feedback by contacting your account team.

## Analyzing metrics

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions doesn't support metrics. 

## Analyzing logs

Azure Monitor for SAP solutions doesn't support resource logs or activity logs. For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs that can be queried by Log Analytics, see [Monitor SAP on Azure data reference](monitor-sap-on-azure-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables). 

### Sample Kusto queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Azure Monitor for SAP solutions menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Azure Monitor for SAP solutions. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other accounts or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../../../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

You can use Kusto queries to help you monitor your Monitor SAP on Azure resources. Here's a sample query that gives you data from a custom log for a specified time range. You specify the time range and the number of rows. In this example, you'll get five rows of data for your selected time range. 

```Kusto
custom log name 
| take 5

```

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them.

You can configure alerts in Azure Monitor for SAP solutions from the Azure portal. For more information, see [Configure Alerts in Azure Monitor for SAP solutions by using the Azure portal](azure-monitor-alerts-portal.md).
