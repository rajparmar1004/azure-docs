# Form Recognizer custom neural model

Custom neural models or neural models are a deep learned model that combines layout and language features to accurately extract labeled fields from documents. The base custom neural model is trained on various document types that makes it suitable to be trained for extracting fields from structured, semi-structured and unstructured documents. The table below lists common document types for each category:

|Documents | Examples |
|---|--|
|structured| surveys, questionnaires|
|semi-structured | invoices, purchase orders |
|unstructured | contracts, letters|

Custom neural models share the same labeling format and strategy as [custom template](concept-custom-template.md) models. Currently custom neural models only support a subset of the field types supported by custom template models.

## Model capabilities

Custom neural models currently only support key-value pairs and selection marks, future releases will include support for structured fields (tables) and signature.

| Form fields | Selection marks | Tabular fields | Signature | Region |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Supported | Supported | Supported | Unsupported | Unsupported |

## Tabular fields

With the release of API version **2022-06-30-preview**, custom neural models will support tabular fields (tables):

* Models trained with API version 2022-06-30-preview or later will accept tabular field labels.
* Documents analyzed with custom neural models using API version 2022-06-30-preview or later will produce tabular fields aggregated across the tables.
* The results can be found in the ```analyzeResult``` object's ```documents``` array that is returned following an analysis operation.

Tabular fields support **cross page tables** by default:

* To label a table that spans multiple pages, label each row of the table across the different pages in a single table.
* As a best practice, ensure that your dataset contains a few samples of the expected variations. For example, include samples where the entire table is on a single page and where tables span two or more pages.

Tabular fields are also useful when extracting repeating information within a document that isn't recognized as a table. For example, a repeating section of work experiences in a resume can be labeled and extracted as a tabular field.

## Supported regions

Starting August 01, 2022, Form Recognizer custom neural model training will only be available in the following Azure regions until further notice:

* Brazil South
* Canada Central
* Central India
* Japan East
* West Europe
* South Central US
* Southeast Asia

> [!TIP]
> You can [copy a model](disaster-recovery.md) trained in one of the select regions listed above to **any other region** and use it accordingly.

## Best practices

Custom neural models differ from custom template models in a few different ways. The custom template or model relies on a consistent visual template to extract the labeled data. Custom neural models support structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents to extract fields. When you're choosing between the two model types, start with a neural model, and test to determine if it supports your functional needs.

### Dealing with variations

Custom neural models can generalize across different formats of a single document type. As a best practice, create a single model for all variations of a document type. Add at least five labeled samples for each of the different variations to the training dataset.

### Field naming

When you label the data, labeling the field relevant to the value will improve the accuracy of the key-value pairs extracted. For example, for a field value containing the supplier ID, consider naming the field "supplier_id". Field names should be in the language of the document.

### Labeling contiguous values

Value tokens/words of one field must be either

* Consecutive sequence in natural reading order without interleaving with other fields
* In a region that don't cover any other fields

### Representative data

Values in training cases should be diverse and representative. For example, if a field is named "date", values for this field should be a date. synthetic value like a random string can affect model performance.

## Current Limitations

* The model doesn't recognize values split across page boundaries.
* Custom neural models are only trained in English and model performance will be lower for documents in other languages.
* If a dataset labeled for custom template models is used to train a custom neural model, the unsupported field types are ignored.
* Custom neural models are limited to 10 build operations per month. Open a support request if you need the limit increased.

## Training a model

Custom neural models are only available in the [v3 API](v3-migration-guide.md).

| Document Type | REST API | SDK | Label and Test Models|
|--|--|--|--|
| Custom document | [Form Recognizer 3.0 (preview)](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-2022-06-30-preview/operations/AnalyzeDocument)| [Form Recognizer Preview SDK](quickstarts/try-v3-python-sdk.md)| [Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio)

The build operation to train model supports a new ```buildMode``` property, to train a custom neural model, set the ```buildMode``` to ```neural```.

```REST
https://{endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels:build?api-version=2022-06-30

{
  "modelId": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "buildMode": "neural",
  "azureBlobSource":
  {
    "containerUrl": "string",
    "prefix": "string"
  }
}
```
