# Form Recognizer models

 Azure Form Recognizer supports a wide variety of models that enable you to add intelligent document processing to your apps and flows. You can use a prebuilt document analysis or domain specific model or train a custom model tailored to your specific business needs and use cases. Form Recognizer can be used with the REST API or Python, C#, Java, and JavaScript SDKs.

### W-2 (preview)

[:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/w2.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=tax.us.w2)

The W-2 model analyzes and extracts key information reported in each box on a W-2 form. The model supports standard and customized forms from 2018 to the present, including single and multiple forms on one page.

### General document (preview)

[:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/general-document.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/document)

* The general document API supports most form types and will analyze your documents and associate values to keys and entries to tables that it discovers. It's ideal for extracting common key-value pairs from documents. You can use the general document model as an alternative to training a custom model without labels.

* The general document is a pre-trained model and can be directly invoked via the REST API.

* The general document model supports named entity recognition (NER) for several entity categories. NER is the ability to identify different entities in text and categorize them into pre-defined classes or types such as: person, location, event, product, and organization. Extracting entities can be useful in scenarios where you want to validate extracted values. The entities are extracted from the entire content.

### Layout

[:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/layout.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/layout)

The Layout API analyzes and extracts text, tables and headers, selection marks, and structure information from documents.

### Invoice

[:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/invoice.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=invoice)

The invoice model analyzes and extracts key information from sales invoices. The API analyzes invoices in various formats and extracts key information such as customer name, billing address, due date, and amount due. Currently, the model supports English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch invoices.

### Receipt

[:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/receipt.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=receipt)

* The receipt model analyzes and extracts key information from printed and handwritten sales receipts.

* The preview version v3.0 also supports single-page hotel receipt processing.

### ID document

[:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/id-document.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=idDocument)

 The ID document model analyzes and extracts key information from the following documents:

* U.S. Driver's Licenses (all 50 states and District of Columbia)

* Biographical pages from international passports (excluding visa and other travel documents). The API analyzes identity documents and extracts

### Business card

[:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/business-card.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/prebuilt?formType=businessCard)

The business card model analyzes and extracts key information from business card images.

### Custom

 [:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom.png":::](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/custommodel/projects)

* Custom models analyze and extract data from forms and documents specific to your business. The API is a machine-learning program trained to recognize form fields within your distinct content and extract key-value pairs and table data. You only need five examples of the same form type to get started and your custom model can be trained with or without labeled datasets.

* The preview version v3.0 custom model supports signature detection in custom forms (template model) and cross-page tables in both template and neural models.

***Sample custom template processed using [Form Recognizer Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects)***:

> [Learn more: custom model](concept-custom.md)

#### Composed custom model

A composed model is created by taking a collection of custom models and assigning them to a single model built from your form types. You can assign multiple custom models to a composed model called with a single model ID. you can assign up to 100 trained custom models to a single composed model.
