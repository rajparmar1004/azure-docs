# Form Recognizer general document model (preview)

The General document preview model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to extract key-value pairs, tables, and selection marks from documents. General document is only available with the preview (v3.0) API.  For more information on using the preview (v3.0) API, see our [migration guide](v3-migration-guide.md).

The general document API supports most form types and will analyze your documents and extract keys and associated values. It's ideal for extracting common key-value pairs from documents. You can use the general document model as an alternative to training a custom model without labels.

> [!NOTE]
> The ```2022-06-30``` update to the general document model adds support for selection marks. 

## General document features

* The general document model is a pre-trained model; it doesn't require labels or training.

* A single API extracts key-value pairs, selection marks, text, tables, and structure from documents.

* The general document model supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents.

* Key names are spans of text within the document that are associated with a value.

* Selection marks are identified as fields with a value of ```:selected:``` or ```:unselected:```

### Try Form Recognizer

Try extracting data from forms and documents using the Form Recognizer Studio.

You'll need the following resources:

* An Azure subscriptionâ€”you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.

#### Form Recognizer Studio (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> Form Recognizer studio and the general document model are available with the preview (v3.0) API.

1. On the Form Recognizer Studio home page, select **General documents**

1. You can analyze the sample document or select the **+ Add** button to upload your own sample.

1. Select the **Analyze** button:

## Key-value pairs

Key-value pairs are specific spans within the document that identify a label or key and its associated response or value. In a structured form, these pairs could be the label and the value the user entered for that field. In an unstructured  document, they could be the date a contract was executed on based on the text in a paragraph.  The AI model is trained to extract identifiable keys and values based on a wide variety of document types, formats, and structures.

Keys can also exist in isolation when the model detects that a key exists, with no associated value or when processing optional fields. For example, a middle name field may be left blank on a form in some instances. Key-value pairs are spans of text contained in the document. If you have documents where the same value is described in different ways, for example, customer and user, the associated key will be either customer or user based on context.

## Data extraction

| **Model**   | **Text extraction** |**Key-Value pairs** |**Selection Marks**   | **Tables**   |
| --- | :---: |:---:| :---: | :---: |
|General document  | âœ“  |  âœ“ | âœ“  | âœ“  |

## Input requirements

* For best results, provide one clear photo or high-quality scan per document.
* Supported file formats: JPEG/JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and PDF (text-embedded or scanned). Text-embedded PDFs are best to eliminate the possibility of error in character extraction and location.
* For PDF and TIFF, up to 2000 pages can be processed (with a free tier subscription, only the first two pages are processed).
* The file size must be less than 500 MB for paid (S0) tier and 4 MB for free (F0) tier.
* Image dimensions must be between 50 x 50 pixels and 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.
* PDF dimensions are up to 17 x 17 inches, corresponding to Legal or A3 paper size, or smaller.
* The total size of the training data is 500 pages or less.
* If your PDFs are password-locked, you must remove the lock before submission.

## Supported languages and locales

| Model | Languageâ€”Locale code | Default |
|--------|:----------------------|:---------|
|General document| <ul><li>English (United States)â€”en-US</li></ul>| English (United States)â€”en-US|

## Considerations

* Keys are spans of text extracted from the document, for semi structured documents, keys may need to be mapped to an existing dictionary of keys.

* Expect to see key-value pairs with a key, but no value. For example if a user chose to not provide an email address on the form.

## Next steps

* Follow our [**Form Recognizer v3.0 migration guide**](v3-migration-guide.md) to learn how to use the preview version in your applications and workflows.

* Explore our [**REST API (preview)**](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v3-0-preview-2/operations/AnalyzeDocument) to learn more about the preview version and new capabilities.
