# Pay for your Azure subscription by check or wire transfer

This article applies to customers with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) and to customers who signed up for Azure through the Azure website (for a Microsoft Online Services Program account also called pay-as-you-go account). If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, then your default payment method is already be set to *check or wire transfer*.

If you switch to pay by check or wire transfer, that means you pay your bill within 30 days of the invoice date by check/wire transfer. 

When you request to change your payment method to check/wire transfer, there are two possible results:

- You're automatically approved and you're prompted for information about your company.
- You're not automatically approved, but you can submit a request to Azure support.

Users with a Microsoft Customer Agreement must always submit a request to Azure support to enable pay by check or wire transfer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Pay by check or wire transfer is only available for customers using Azure on behalf of a company.
> * Pay all outstanding charges before switching to pay by by check or wire transfer.
> * An outstanding invoice is paid by your default payment method. In order to have it paid by check or wire transfer, you must change your default payment method to check or wire transfer after you've been approved.
> * Currently, payment by check or wire transfer isn't supported for Global Azure in China.
> * For Microsoft Online Services Program accounts, if you switch to pay by check or wire transfer, you can't switch back to paying by credit or debit card.
