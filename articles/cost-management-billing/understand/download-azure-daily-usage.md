# View and download your Azure usage and charges

You can download a daily breakdown of your Azure usage and charges in the Azure portal. Only certain roles have permission to get Azure usage information, like the Account Administrator or Enterprise Administrator. To learn more about getting access to billing information, see [Manage access to Azure billing using roles](../manage/manage-billing-access.md).

If you have a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), you must be a billing profile Owner, Contributor, Reader, or Invoice manager to view your Azure usage and charges. If you have a Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), only the Global Admin and Admin Agent role in the partner organization Microsoft can view and download Azure usage and charges.

Based on the type of subscription that you use, options to download your usage and charges vary.

If you want to get cost and usage data using the Azure CLI, see [Get usage data with the Azure CLI](../automate/get-usage-data-azure-cli.md).

## Get usage data with Azure CLI

Start by preparing your environment for the Azure CLI:

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](../../../includes/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

Then use the [az costmanagement export](/cli/azure/costmanagement/export) commands to export usage data to an Azure storage account. You can download the data from there.

1. Create a resource group or use an existing resource group. To create a resource group, run the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command:

   ```azurecli
   az group create --name TreyNetwork --location "East US"
   ```

1. Create a storage account to receive the exports or use an existing storage account. To create an account, use the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create) command:

   ```azurecli
   az storage account create --resource-group TreyNetwork --name cmdemo
   ```

1. Run the [az costmanagement export create](/cli/azure/costmanagement/export#az-costmanagement-export-create) command to create the export:

   ```azurecli
   az costmanagement export create --name DemoExport --type Usage \
   --scope "subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" --storage-account-id cmdemo \
   --storage-container democontainer --timeframe MonthToDate --storage-directory demodirectory
