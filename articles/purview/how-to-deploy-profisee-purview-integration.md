# Microsoft Purview - Profisee Integration

Master data management (MDM) is a key pillar of any unified data governance solution. Microsoft Purview supports master data management with our partner [Profisee](https://profisee.com/profisee-advantage/). This tutorial compiles reference and integration deployment materials in one place to get you started on your MDM journey with Microsoft Purview through our integration with Profisee.

## What, why and how of MDM - Master Data Management?

Many businesses today have large data estates that move massive amounts of data between applications, storage systems, analytics systems, and across departments within their organization. During these movements, and over time, data can be accidentally duplicated or fragment, and can fall out of date, so accuracy becomes a concern when using this data for analytics about your business.

To protect the quality of data within an organization, master data management (MDM) arose as a discipline that creates a source of truth for enterprise data so that an organization can check and validate their key assets. These key assets, or master data assets, are critical records that provide context for a business. For example, master data might include information on specific products, employees, customers, financial structures, suppliers, or locations. Master data management ensures data quality across an entire organization by maintaining the quality of the master data records, and ensuring data remains consistent across their entire data estate.

As an example, it can be difficult for a company to have a clear, single view of their customers. Customer data may differ between systems, there may be duplicated records due to incorrect entry, or shipping and customer service systems may vary due to name, address, or other attributes. Master data management consolidates all this differing information about the customer it into a single, standard format that can be used to check data across an organizations entire data estate.

Not only does this improve quality of data by eliminating mismatched data across departments, but it ensures that data analyzed for business intelligence (BI) and other applications is trustworthy and up to date, reduces data load by removing duplicate records across the organization, and streamlines communications between business systems.

## Microsoft Purview - Profisee reference architecture

### Reference architecture guides/reference documents

- [Data Governance with Profisee and Microsoft Purview](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/profisee-master-data-management-purview)
- [Operationalize Profisee with ADF Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/profisee-master-data-management-data-factory)
- [MDM on Azure Overview](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/govern-master-data)

### Example scenario: Business & technical use case

Let's take an example of a sample manufacturing company working across multiple data sources; it uses ADF to load the business critical data sources into Profisee, which is when Profisee works its magic and finds out the golden records and matching records and then we finally are able to enrich the metadata with Microsoft Purview (updates made by Microsoft Purview on Classifications, Sensitivity Labels, Glossary and all other Catalog features are reflected seamlessly into Profisee). Finally, they connect the enriched metadata detected by Microsoft Purview and cleansed/curated data by Profisee with Power BI or Azure ML for advanced analytics.

## Microsoft Purview - Profisee integration SaaS deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) guide

1. [Create a user-assigned managed identity in Azure](/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity). You must have a managed identity created to run the deployment. This managed identity must have the following permissions when running a deployment. After the deployment is done, the managed identity can be deleted. Based on your ARM template choices, you'll need some or all of the following roles and permissions assigned to your managed identity:
    - Contributor role to the resource group where AKS will be deployed. It can either be assigned directly to the resource group **OR** at the subscription level and down.
    - DNS Zone Contributor role to the particular DNS zone where the entry will be created **OR** Contributor role to the DNS Zone resource group. This DNS role is needed only if updating DNS hosted in Azure.
    - Application Administrator role in Azure Active Directory so the required permissions that are needed for the application registration can be assigned.
    - Managed Identity Contributor and User Access Administrator at the subscription level. Required in order for the ARM template managed identity to be able to create a Key Vault specific managed identity that will be used by Profisee to pull the values stored in the Key Vault.
    - Data Curator Role added for the Microsoft Purview account for the Microsoft Purview specific application registration.  

1. Go to [https://github.com/Profisee/kubernetes](https://github.com/Profisee/kubernetes) and select Microsoft Purview [**Azure ARM**](https://github.com/profisee/kubernetes/blob/master/Azure-ARM/README.md#deploy-profisee-platform-on-to-aks-using-arm-template).
    - The ARM template will deploy Profisee on a load balanced AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) infrastructure using an ingress controller.
    - The readme includes troubleshooting steps.l
    - Read all the steps and troubleshooting wiki page carefully.  

1. Get the license file from Profisee by raising a support ticket on [https://support.profisee.com/](https://support.profisee.com/). Only pre-requisite for this step is your need to pre-determine the DNS resolved URL your Profisee setup on Azure. In other words, keep the DNS HOST NAME of the load balancer used in the deployment. It will be something like "[profisee_name].[region].cloudapp.azure.com".
For example, DNSHOSTNAME="purviewprofisee.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com". Supply this DNSHOSTNAME to Profisee support when you raise the support ticket and Profisee will revert with the license file. You'll need to supply this file during the next configuration steps below.  

1. Select "Deploy to Azure"

    [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fprofisee%2Fkubernetes%2Fmaster%2FAzure-ARM%2Fazuredeploy.json/createUIDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fprofisee%2Fkubernetes%2Fmaster%2FAzure-ARM%2FcreateUIDefinition.json)
    - The configurator wizard will ask for the inputs as described here - [Deploying the AKS Cluster using the ARM Template](https://support.profisee.com/wikis/2022_r1_support/deploying_the_AKS_cluster_with_the_arm_template)
    - Make sure to give the exact same RG (Resource Group) in the deployment as you gave permissions to the managed identity in Step1.  

1. Once deployment completes, select Microsoft Purview "Go to Resource Group" and open the Profisee AKS Cluster.

### Stages of a typical Microsoft Purview - Profisee deployment run
