# Pre-Call diagnostic

[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Disclaimer](../../includes/private-preview-include-section.md)]

The Pre-Call API enables developers to programmatically validate a clientâ€™s readiness to join an Azure Communication Services Call. The Pre-Call APIs can be accessed through the Calling SDK. They provide multiple diagnostics including device, connection, and call quality. Pre-Call APIs are available only for Web (JavaScript). We will be enabling these capabilities across platforms in the future, please provide us feedback on what platforms you would like to see Pre-Call APIs on.

## Accessing Pre-Call APIs

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Pre-Call diagnostics are available starting on the version [1.5.2-alpha.20220415.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/communication-calling/v/1.5.2-alpha.20220415.1) of the Calling SDK. Make sure to use that version when trying the instructions below.

To Access the Pre-Call API, you will need to initialize a `callClient` and provision an Azure Communication Services access token. There you can access the `PreCallDiagnostics` feature and the `startTest` method.

```javascript
import { CallClient, Features} from "@azure/communication-calling";
import { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential } from '@azure/communication-common';

const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(); 
const preCallDiagnosticsResult = await callClient.feature(Features.PreCallDiagnostics).startTest(tokenCredential);

```

Once it finishes running, developers can access the result object.

## Diagnostic results

The Pre-Call API returns a full diagnostic of the device including details like device permissions, availability and compatibility, call quality stats and in-call diagnostics. The results are returned as a `PreCallDiagnosticsResult` object. 

```javascript

export declare type PreCallDiagnosticsResult  = {
    deviceAccess: Promise<DeviceAccess>;
    deviceEnumeration: Promise<DeviceEnumeration>;
    inCallDiagnostics: Promise<InCallDiagnostics>;
    browserSupport?: Promise<DeviceCompatibility>;
    id: string;
    callMediaStatistics?: Promise<MediaStatsCallFeature>;
};

```

Individual result objects can be accessed as such using the `preCallDiagnosticsResult` constant above. Results for individual tests will be returned as they are completed with many of the test results being available immediately. In the case of the `inCallDiagnostics` test, the results might take up to 1 minute as the test validates quality of the video and audio.

### Browser support
Browser compatibility check. Checks for `Browser` and `OS` compatibility and provides a `Supported` or `NotSupported` value back. 

```javascript

const browserSupport =  await preCallDiagnosticsResult.browserSupport;
  if(browserSupport) {
    console.log(browserSupport.browser)
    console.log(browserSupport.os)
  }

```

In the case that the test fails and the browser being used by the user is `NotSupported`, the easiest way to fix that is by asking the user to switch to a supported browser. Refer to the supported browsers in our [documentation](./calling-sdk-features.md#javascript-calling-sdk-support-by-os-and-browser).

>[!NOTE]
>Known issue: `browser support` test returning `Unknown` in cases where it should be returning a correct value.

### Device access
Permission check. Checks whether video and audio devices are available from a permissions perspective. Provides `boolean` value for `audio` and `video` devices. 

```javascript

  const deviceAccess =  await preCallDiagnosticsResult.deviceAccess;
  if(deviceAccess) {
    console.log(deviceAccess.audio)
    console.log(deviceAccess.video)
  }

```

In the case that the test fails and the permissions are false for audio and video, the user shouldn't continue into joining a call. Rather you will need to prompt the user to enable the permissions. To do this, it is best to provide specific instruction on how to access permission access based on the OS, version and browser they are on. For more information on permissions check out our [recommendations](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-communication-services/checklist-for-advanced-calling-experiences-in-mobile-web/ba-p/3266312).

### Device enumeration
Device availability. Checks whether microphone, camera and speaker devices are detected in the system and ready to use. Provides an `Available` or `NotAvailable` value back.

```javascript

  const deviceEnumeration = await preCallDiagnosticsResult.deviceEnumeration;
  if(deviceEnumeration) {
    console.log(deviceEnumeration.microphone)
    console.log(deviceEnumeration.camera)
    console.log(deviceEnumeration.speaker)
  }

```

In the case that devices are not available, the user shouldn't continue into joining a call. Rather the user should be prompted to check device connections to ensure any headsets, cameras or speakers are properly connected. For more information on device management check out our [documentation](../../how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-video.md?pivots=platform-web#device-management)

### InCall diagnostics
Performs a quick call to check in-call metrics for audio and video and provides results back. Includes connectivity (`connected`, boolean), bandwidth quality (`bandWidth`, `'Bad' | 'Average' | 'Good'`) and call diagnostics for audio and video (`diagnostics`). Diagnostic are provided `jitter`, `packetLoss` and `rtt` and results are generated using a simple quality grade (`'Bad' | 'Average' | 'Good'`).

InCall diagnostics leverages [media quality stats](./media-quality-sdk.md) to calculate quality scores and diagnose issues. During the pre-call diagnostic, the full set of media quality stats are available for consumption. These will include raw values across video and audio metrics that can be used programatically. The InCall diagnostic provides a convenience layer on top of media quality stats to consume the results without the need to process all the raw data. See section on media stats for instructions to access.

```javascript

  const inCallDiagnostics =  await preCallDiagnosticsResult.inCallDiagnostics;
  if(inCallDiagnostics) {    
    console.log(inCallDiagnostics.connected)
    console.log(inCallDiagnostics.bandWidth)
    console.log(inCallDiagnostics.diagnostics.audio)
    console.log(inCallDiagnostics.diagnostics.video)
  }

```

At this step, there are multiple failure points to watch out for:

- If connection fails, the user should be prompted to recheck their network connectivity. Connection failures can also be attributed to network conditions like DNS, Proxies or Firewalls. For more information on recommended network setting check out our [documentation](network-requirements.md).
- If bandwidth is `Bad`, the user should be prompted to try out a different network or verify the bandwidth availability on their current one. Ensure no other high bandwidth activities might be taking place.

### Media stats
For granular stats on quality metrics like jitter, packet loss, rtt, etc. `callMediaStatistics` are provided as part of the `preCallDiagnosticsResult` feature.  See the [full list and description of the available metrics](./media-quality-sdk.md) in the linked article.  You can subscribe to the call media stats to get full collection of them. This is the raw metrics that are used to calculate InCall diagnostic results and which can be consumed granularly for further analysis.

## Pricing

When the Pre-Call diagnostic test runs, behind the scenes it uses calling minutes to run the diagnostic. The test lasts for roughly 1 minute, using up 1 minute of calling which is charged at the standard rate of $0.004 per participant per minute. For the case of Pre-Call diagnostic, the charge will be for 1 participant x 1 minutes = $0.004. 

## Next steps

This feature is currently in private preview. Please provide feedback on the API design, capabilities and pricing. Feedback is key for the team to move forward and push the feature into public preview and general availability.
