# Limited Access features for Cognitive Services

Our vision is to empower developers and organizations to leverage AI to transform society in positive ways. We encourage responsible AI practices to protect the rights and safety of individuals. To achieve this, Microsoft has implemented a Limited Access policy grounded in our [AI Principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai) to support responsible deployment of Azure services. 

## What is Limited Access? 

Limited Access services require registration, and only customers managed by Microsoft, meaning those who are working directly with Microsoft account teams, are eligible for access. The use of these services is limited to the use case selected at the time of registration. Customers must acknowledge that they have reviewed and agree to the terms of service. Microsoft may require customers to re-verify this information. 

Limited Access services are made available to customers under the terms governing their subscription to Microsoft Azure Services (including the [Service Specific Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2018760)). Please review these terms carefully as they contain important conditions and obligations governing your use of Limited Access services.

### I’m an existing customer who applied for access to Custom Neural Voice or Speaker Recognition, do I have to apply to keep using these services?
