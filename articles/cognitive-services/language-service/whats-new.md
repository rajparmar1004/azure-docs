    * Performance and quality improvements for the following 11 [languages](./sentiment-opinion-mining/language-support.md) supported by sentiment analysis: `ar`, `da`, `el`, `fi`, `hi`, `nl`, `no`, `pl`,  `ru`, `sv`, `tr` 
    * Performance and quality improvements for the following 20 [languages](./key-phrase-extraction/language-support.md) supported by key phrase extraction: `af`, `bg`, `ca`, `hr`, `da`, `nl`, `et`, `fi`, `el`, `hu`, `id`, `lv`, `no`, `pl`, `ro`, `ru`, `sk`, `sl`, `sv`, `tr` 


## June 2022
* v1.0 client libraries for [conversational language understanding](./conversational-language-understanding/how-to/call-api.md?tabs=azure-sdk#send-a-conversational-language-understanding-request) and [orchestration workflow](./orchestration-workflow/how-to/call-api.md?tabs=azure-sdk#send-an-orchestration-workflow-request) are Generally Available for the following languages:
    * [C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/Azure.AI.Language.Conversations_1.0.0/sdk/cognitivelanguage/Azure.AI.Language.Conversations)
    * [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/azure-ai-language-conversations_1.0.0/sdk/cognitivelanguage/azure-ai-language-conversations)

    * [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/azure-ai-language-conversations_1.1.0b1/sdk/cognitivelanguage/azure-ai-language-conversations/samples/README.md)
* There is a new endpoint URL and request format for making REST API calls to prebuilt Language service features. See the following quickstart guides and [reference documentation](/rest/api/language/) for information on structuring your API calls. All text analytics 3.2-preview.2 API users can begin migrating their workloads to this new endpoint.
    * [Entity linking](./entity-linking/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api)
    * [Language detection](./language-detection/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api)
    * [Key phrase extraction](./key-phrase-extraction/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api)
    * [Named entity recognition](./named-entity-recognition/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api)
    * [PII detection](./personally-identifiable-information/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api)
    * [Sentiment analysis and opinion mining](./sentiment-opinion-mining/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api)
    * [Text analytics for health](./text-analytics-for-health/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api)

* Conversation summarization is now available in public preview.

* The following features are now Generally Available (GA):
    * Custom text classification
    * Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    * Conversational language understanding
    * Orchestration workflow

* The following updates for custom text classification, custom Named Entity Recognition (NER), conversational language understanding, and orchestration workflow:
    * Data splitting controls.
    * Ability to cancel training jobs.
    * Custom deployments can be named. You can have up to 10 deployments.
    * Ability to swap deployments.
    * Auto labeling (preview) for custom named entity recognition
    * Enterprise readiness support

## April 2022

* Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) support is available in the [Language REST API preview](text-analytics-for-health/quickstart.md?pivots=rest-api&tabs=language) for Text Analytics for health.

## March 2022

* Expanded language support for:
  * [Custom text classification](custom-classification/language-support.md)
  * [Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER)](custom-named-entity-recognition/language-support.md)
  * [Conversational language understanding](conversational-language-understanding/language-support.md)

## February 2022

* Model improvements for latest model-version for [text summarization](summarization/overview.md)
