[Reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/ai-text-analytics-readme?preserve-view=true&view=azure-node-latest) | [Additional samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-text-analytics/v/5.1.0) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics)

Use this quickstart to create an entity linking application with the client library for Node.js. In the following example, you will create a JavaScript application that can identify and disambiguate entities found in text.


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 LTS
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp 

cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Install the npm package:

```console
npm install @azure/ai-text-analytics@5.1.0
```

## Code example

Open the file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. 

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
"use strict";

const { TextAnalyticsClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-text-analytics");
const endpoint = '<paste-your-endpoint-here>';
const key = '<paste-your-key-here>';
// Authenticate the client with your key and endpoint.
const textAnalyticsClient = new TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint,  new AzureKeyCredential(key));

// Example method for recognizing entities and providing a link to an online data source.
async function linkedEntityRecognition(client){

    const linkedEntityInput = [
        "Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer, president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014."
    ];
    const entityResults = await client.recognizeLinkedEntities(linkedEntityInput);

    entityResults.forEach(document => {
        console.log(`Document ID: ${document.id}`);
        document.entities.forEach(entity => {
            console.log(`\tName: ${entity.name} \tID: ${entity.dataSourceEntityId} \tURL: ${entity.url} \tData Source: ${entity.dataSource}`);
            console.log(`\tMatches:`)
            entity.matches.forEach(match => {
                console.log(`\t\tText: ${match.text} \tScore: ${match.confidenceScore.toFixed(2)}`);
        })
        });
    });
}
linkedEntityRecognition(textAnalyticsClient);

```
