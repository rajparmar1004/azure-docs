[Reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/azure/ai-text-analytics-readme?preserve-view=true&view=azure-node-latest) | [Additional samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics/samples) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/ai-text-analytics/v/5.1.0) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/ai-text-analytics)

Use this quickstart to create a sentiment analysis application with the client library for Node.js. In the following example, you will create a JavaScript application that can identify the sentiment(s) expressed in a text sample, and perform aspect-based sentiment analysis.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 LTS
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.

## Setting up

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp 

cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Install the npm packages:

```console
npm install @azure/ai-text-analytics@5.1.0
```

## Code example

Open the file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. 

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```javascript
"use strict";

const { TextAnalyticsClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-text-analytics");
const key = '<paste-your-key-here>';
const endpoint = '<paste-your-endpoint-here>';
// Authenticate the client with your key and endpoint.
const textAnalyticsClient = new TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint,  new AzureKeyCredential(key));

// Example method for detecting sentiment and opinions in text.
async function sentimentAnalysisWithOpinionMining(client){

  const sentimentInput = [
    {
      text: "The food and service were unacceptable. The concierge was nice, however.",
      id: "0",
      language: "en"
    }
  ];
  const results = await client.analyzeSentiment(sentimentInput, { includeOpinionMining: true });

  for (let i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
    const result = results[i];
    console.log(`- Document ${result.id}`);
    if (!result.error) {
      console.log(`\tDocument text: ${sentimentInput[i].text}`);
      console.log(`\tOverall Sentiment: ${result.sentiment}`);
      console.log("\tSentiment confidence scores:", result.confidenceScores);
      console.log("\tSentences");
      for (const { sentiment, confidenceScores, opinions } of result.sentences) {
        console.log(`\t- Sentence sentiment: ${sentiment}`);
        console.log("\t  Confidence scores:", confidenceScores);
        console.log("\t  Mined opinions");
        for (const { target, assessments } of opinions) {
          console.log(`\t\t- Target text: ${target.text}`);
          console.log(`\t\t  Target sentiment: ${target.sentiment}`);
          console.log("\t\t  Target confidence scores:", target.confidenceScores);
          console.log("\t\t  Target assessments");
          for (const { text, sentiment } of assessments) {
            console.log(`\t\t\t- Text: ${text}`);
            console.log(`\t\t\t  Sentiment: ${sentiment}`);
          }
        }
      }
    } else {
      console.error(`\tError: ${result.error}`);
    }
  }
}
sentimentAnalysisWithOpinionMining(textAnalyticsClient);
```
