# Language and voice support for the Speech service

Language support varies by Speech service functionality. The following tables summarize language support for [speech-to-text](#speech-to-text), [text-to-speech](#text-to-speech), [speech translation](#speech-translation), and [speaker recognition](#speaker-recognition) service offerings.

## Speech-to-text

The Speech service supports the languages (locales) in the following tables.

To improve accuracy, customization is available for some languages and base model versions by uploading audio + human-labeled transcripts, plain text, structured text, and pronunciation. By default, plain text customization is supported for all available base models. To learn more about customization, see [Custom Speech](./custom-speech-overview.md).

## Text-to-speech

Both the Microsoft Speech SDK and REST APIs support these neural voices, each of which supports a specific language and dialect, identified by locale. You can try the demo and hear the voices on [this website](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#features).

You can also get a full list of languages and voices supported for each specific region or endpoint through the [voices list API](rest-text-to-speech.md#get-a-list-of-voices). To learn how you can configure and adjust neural voices, such as Speaking Styles, see [Speech Synthesis Markup Language](speech-synthesis-markup.md#adjust-speaking-styles).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pricing varies for Prebuilt Neural Voice (referred to as *Neural* on the pricing page) and Custom Neural Voice (referred to as *Custom Neural*¬†on the pricing page). For more information, see the [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) page.


### Prebuilt neural voices

Prebuilt neural voices are created from samples that use a 24-khz sample rate. All voices can upsample or downsample to other sample rates when synthesizing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The English (United Kingdom) voice `en-GB-MiaNeural` retired on October 30, 2021. All service requests to `en-GB-MiaNeural` will be redirected to `en-GB-SoniaNeural` automatically as of October 30, 2021.
> 
> If you're using container Neural TTS, [download](speech-container-howto.md#get-the-container-image-with-docker-pull) and deploy the latest version. Starting from October 30, 2021, all requests with previous versions will not succeed.
> 
> The `en-US-JessaNeural` voice has changed to `en-US-AriaNeural`. If you were using "Jessa" before, convert  to "Aria." You can continue to use the full service name mapping like "Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, AriaNeural)" in your speech synthesis requests.

The following table lists the prebuilt neural voices supported in each language.

### Voice styles and roles

In some cases, you can adjust the speaking style to express different emotions like cheerfulness, empathy, and calm. You can optimize the voice for different scenarios like customer service, newscast, and voice assistant. With roles, the same voice can act as a different age and gender.

> [!NOTE]
> The angry, cheerful, excited, friendly, hopeful, sad, shouting, terrified, unfriendly, and whispering styles for DavisNeural, JaneNeural, JasonNeural, NancyNeural and TonyNeural are only available in three service regions: East US, West Europe, and Southeast Asia. 
To learn how you can configure and adjust neural voice styles and roles, see [Speech Synthesis Markup Language](speech-synthesis-markup.md#adjust-speaking-styles).

Use the following table to determine supported styles and roles for each neural voice.

### Custom Neural Voice

Custom Neural Voice lets you create synthetic voices that are rich in speaking styles. You can create a unique brand voice in multiple languages and styles by using a small set of recording data.  

Select the right locale that matches your training data to train a custom neural voice model. For example, if the recording data is spoken in English with a British accent, select `en-GB`. 

With the cross-lingual feature (preview), you can transfer your custom neural voice model to speak a second language. For example, with the `zh-CN` data, you can create a voice that speaks `en-AU` or any of the languages marked with "Yes" in the Cross-lingual column in the following table.  

There are two Custom Neural Voice (CNV) project types: CNV Pro and CNV Lite (preview). In the following table, all the languages are supported by CNV Pro, and the languages marked with "Yes" in the Custom Neural Voice Lite column are supported by CNV Lite.

## Speech translation

The Speech Translation API supports different languages for speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation. The source language must always be from the speech-to-text language table. The available target languages depend on whether the translation target is speech or text. You may translate incoming speech into any of the [supported languages](https://www.microsoft.com/translator/business/languages/). A subset of languages is available for [speech synthesis](language-support.md#text-languages).

## Speaker recognition

Speaker recognition is mostly language agnostic. We built a universal model for text-independent speaker recognition by combining various data sources from multiple languages. We've tuned and evaluated the model on the languages and locales that appear in the following table. For more information on speaker recognition, see the [overview](speaker-recognition-overview.md).
