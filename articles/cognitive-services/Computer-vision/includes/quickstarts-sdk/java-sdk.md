Use the OCR client library to read printed and handwritten text from a remote image. The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. For more information on text recognition, see the [Optical character recognition (OCR)](../../overview-ocr.md) overview. 

> [!TIP]
> You can also read text in a local image. See the [ComputerVision](/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.computervision) methods, such as **read**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart.java) for scenarios involving local images.

[Reference documentation](/java/api/overview/azure/cognitiveservices/client/computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/ms-azure-cs-computervision) |[Artifact (Maven)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-computervision) | [Samples](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/?service=cognitive-services&term=vision&sort=0)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* The current version of the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* The [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/install/), or another dependency manager.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

## Read printed and handwritten text

1. Create a new Gradle project.

    In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

    ```console
    mkdir myapp && cd myapp
    ```

    Run the `gradle init` command from your working directory. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, including *build.gradle.kts*, which is used at runtime to create and configure your application.

    ```console
    gradle init --type basic
    ```

    When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

1. Install the client library.

    This quickstart uses the Gradle dependency manager. You can find the client library and information for other dependency managers on the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-computervision).

    Locate *build.gradle.kts* and open it with your preferred IDE or text editor. Then copy in the following build configuration. This configuration defines the project as a Java application whose entry point is the class **ComputerVisionQuickstart**. It imports the Computer Vision library.

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        java
        application
    }
    application { 
        mainClass.set("ComputerVisionQuickstart")
    }
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        implementation(group = "com.microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices", name = "azure-cognitiveservices-computervision", version = "1.0.6-beta")
    }
    ```

1. Set up a test image.

    Create a **resources/** folder in the **src/main/** folder of your project, and add an image you'd like to read text from. You can download a [sample image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/master/articles/cognitive-services/Computer-vision/Images/readsample.jpg) to use here.

1. Create a Java file.

    From your working directory, run the following command to create a project source folder:

    ```console
    mkdir -p src/main/java
    ```

    Navigate to the new folder and create a file called *ComputerVisionQuickstart.java*. Open it in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Find the key and endpoint.

    [!INCLUDE [find key and endpoint](../find-key.md)]

1. Replace the contents of the file with the following code. This code defines a method, `ReadFromUrl`, that takes a remote image path and prints the image's text to the console.

   [!code-java[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/java/ComputerVision/src/main/java/ComputerVisionQuickstart-single.java?name=snippet_single)]

1. Paste your key and endpoint into the above code where indicated. Your Computer Vision endpoint has the form `https://<your_computer_vision_resource_name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. For example, [Azure key vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md).

1. Build the app with the following command:

   ```console
   gradle build
   ```

   Then, run the application with the `gradle run` command:

   ```console
   gradle run
   ```

## Output

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to install the OCR client library and use the Read API. Next, learn more about the Read API features.
