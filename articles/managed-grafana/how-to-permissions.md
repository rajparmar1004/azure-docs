# How to modify access permissions to Azure Monitor

By default, when a Grafana instance is created, Azure Managed Grafana grants it the Monitoring Reader role for all Azure Monitor data and Log Analytics resources within a subscription.

This means that the new Grafana instance can access and search all monitoring data in the subscription, including viewing the Azure Monitor metrics and logs from all resources, and any logs stored in Log Analytics workspaces in the subscription.

In this article, you'll learn how to manually edit permissions for a specific resource.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet).
- An Azure Managed Grafana instance. If you don't have one yet, [create an Azure Managed Grafana instance](./quickstart-managed-grafana-portal.md).
- An Azure resource with monitoring data and write permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](../../articles/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner)

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Azure account.

## Edit Azure Monitor permissions

To change permissions for a specific resource, follow these steps:

1. Open a resource that contains the monitoring data you want to retrieve. In this example, we're configuring an Application Insights resource.
1. Select **Access Control (IAM)**.
1. Under **Grant access to this resource**, select **Add role assignment**.
