You can enable a test drive that lets customers try your offer prior to purchase by giving them access to a preconfigured environment for a fixed number of hours, resulting in highly qualified leads and an increased conversion rate. Test drives differ depending on the offer type and marketplace. To learn more about types of test drives and how they work, see [What is a test drive?](../what-is-test-drive.md). For information about configuring different kinds of test drives, see [Test drive technical configuration](../test-drive-technical-configuration.md).

> [!TIP]
> A test drive is different from a [free trial](../plans-pricing.md#free-trials). You can offer a test drive, free trial, or both. They both provide your customers with your solution for a fixed period-of-time. But, a test drive also includes a hands-on, self-guided tour of your productâ€™s key features and benefits being demonstrated in a real-world implementation scenario.
