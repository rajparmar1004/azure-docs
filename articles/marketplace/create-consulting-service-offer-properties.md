# Configure consulting service offer properties

This article describes how to configure the properties of a consulting service offer in the Microsoft commercial marketplace.

On the **Properties** tab of your offer in Partner Center, you’ll define the primary product at the core of your consulting service, the service type, and the applicable industries. You’ll also indicate the relevant Microsoft competencies you earned. The information in this tab ensures your consulting service is displayed correctly in the commercial marketplace and offered to the right set of customers.

## Select the primary product

In the **Primary Product** dropdown list, select the Microsoft product that will be the focus of your consulting service offer. The product you select will determine whether your offer will be published to Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace. Accurately representing your offer makes it easier for customers to find your offer. Keep in mind that you must meet the [eligibility requirements](./plan-consulting-service-offer.md#eligibility-requirements) for the products you select. 

- If you select Azure, the offer will be listed on Azure Marketplace. Select up to three **Solution Areas** which best represent your offer.
- If you select Microsoft 365, also choose up to three **Solution Areas** which best represent your offer. The offer will be listed in Microsoft AppSource.
-	If you select any Dynamics 365 or Power Platform product, you may also select two additional **Applicable products**. The offer will be listed in Microsoft AppSource.

## Select the consulting service type

In the **Consulting service type** dropdown, select the type of consulting service you’ll offer to customers. The available types are:

- **Assessment**: An evaluation of a customer's environment to determine the applicability of a solution and to estimate the cost and timeline of its implementation.
- **Briefing**: An introduction to a solution or a service using frameworks, demos, and customer examples.
- **Implementation**: A complete installation that results in a fully working solution.
- **Proof of concept**: A limited-scope implementation to determine whether a solution meets the customer's requirements.
- **Workshop**: An interactive engagement conducted on the customer's premises. It can involve training, briefings, assessments, or demos built on the customer's data or environment.

## Select relevant industries

The information in this section helps us categorize your offer so that customers will easily find it on the Microsoft online stores.

- If you selected Azure as primary product, select up to six **Industries**. See the full list of industries in [Offer Listing Best Practices](./gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md).
- If you selected a primary product other than Azure, you have the option to select up to two **Industries** and two **Sub-industries** for each industry. See the full list of industries and sub-industries in [Offer Listing Best Practices](./gtm-offer-listing-best-practices.md).

## Select your competencies

Select up to three competencies that are relevant to the service area of your offer. Your selection will be displayed to customers in the offer listing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Having at least one competency may be a requirement to publish your offer, depending on its primary product. See the [certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#800-consulting-services) for details.
