# Define the availability of a Power BI visual offer

The _Availability_ page lets you define where and how to make your offer available, including markets and release date.

## Markets

1. To specify the markets in which your offer should be available, select **Edit markets**.

    Your selections here apply only to new acquisitions; if someone already has your app in a market you later remove, they can continue using it, but no new customers in that market will be able to get your offer.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >It is your responsibility to meet any local legal requirements, even if those requirements aren't listed here or in Partner Center. Even if you select all markets, local laws, restrictions, or other factors may prevent certain offers from being listed in some countries and regions.

1. Select the markets you want and then select **Save**.
1. Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu: **Technical configuration**.
