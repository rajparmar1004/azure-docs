# Clean up unmanaged Azure Active Directory accounts

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) supports self-service sign-up for
email-verified users. Users can create Azure AD accounts if they can
verify email ownership. To learn more, see, [What is self-service
sign-up for Azure Active
Directory?](./directory-self-service-signup.md)

However, if a user creates an account, and the domain isn't verified in
an Azure AD tenant, the user is created in an unmanaged, or viral
tenant. The user can create an account with an organization's domain,
not under the lifecycle management of the organization's IT. Access can
persist after the user leaves the organization.

## Remove unmanaged Azure AD accounts

You can remove unmanaged Azure AD accounts from your Azure AD tenants
and prevent these types of accounts from redeeming future invitations.

1. Enable [email one-time
    passcode](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md#enable-email-one-time-passcode)
    (OTP).

2. Use the sample application in [Azure-samples/Remove-unmanaged-guests](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Remove-Unmanaged-Guests) or
    go to
    [AzureAD/MSIdentityTools](https://github.com/AzureAD/MSIdentityTools/wiki/)
    PowerShell module to identify viral users in an Azure AD tenant and
    reset user redemption status.

Once the above steps are complete, when users with unmanaged Azure AD accounts try to access your tenant, they'll re-redeem their invitations. However, because Email OTP is enabled, Azure AD will prevent users from redeeming with an existing unmanaged Azure AD account and theyâ€™ll redeem with another account type. Google Federation and SAML/WS-Fed aren't enabled by default. So by default, these users will redeem with either an MSA or Email OTP, with MSA taking precedence. For a full explanation on the B2B redemption precedence, refer to the [redemption precedence flow chart](../external-identities/redemption-experience.md#invitation-redemption-flow).

## Overtaken tenants and domains

Some tenants created as unmanaged tenants can be taken over and
converted to a managed tenant. See, [take over an unmanaged directory as
administrator in Azure AD](./domains-admin-takeover.md).

In some cases, overtaken domains might not be updated, for example, missing a DNS TXT record and therefore become flagged as unmanaged. Implications are:

- For guest users who belong to formerly unmanaged tenants, redemption status is reset and one consent prompt appears. Redemption occurs with same account as before.

- After unmanaged user redemption status is reset, the tool might identify unmanaged users that are false positives.

## Reset redemption using a sample application

Before you begin, to identify and reset unmanaged Azure AD account redemption:

1. Ensure email OTP is enabled.

2. Use the sample application on
    [Azure-Samples/Remove-Unmanaged-Guests](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Remove-Unmanaged-Guests).

## Reset redemption using MSIdentityTools PowerShell Module

MSIdentityTools PowerShell Module is a collection of cmdlets and
scripts. They are for use in the Microsoft identity platform and Azure
AD; they augment capabilities in the PowerShell SDK. See, [Microsoft
Graph PowerShell
SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell).

Run the following cmdlets:

- `Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser`

- `Install-Module MSIdentityTools`

- `Import-Module msidentitytools,microsoft.graph`

To identify unmanaged Azure AD accounts, run:

- `Connect-MgGraph --Scope User.Read.All`

- `Get-MsIdUnmanagedExternalUser`

To reset unmanaged Azure AD account redemption status, run:

- `Connect-MgGraph --Scope User.Readwrite.All`

- `Get-MsIdUnmanagedExternalUser | Reset-MsIdExternalUser`

To delete unmanaged Azure AD accounts, run:

- `Connect-MgGraph --Scope User.Readwrite.All`

- `Get-MsIdUnmanagedExternalUser | Remove-MgUser`
