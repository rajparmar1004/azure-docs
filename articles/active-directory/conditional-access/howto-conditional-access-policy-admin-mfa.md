# Conditional Access: Require MFA for administrators

Accounts that are assigned administrative rights are targeted by attackers. Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) on those accounts is an easy way to reduce the risk of those accounts being compromised.

Microsoft recommends you require MFA on the following roles at a minimum, based on [identity score recommendations](../fundamentals/identity-secure-score.md):

- Global administrator
- Application administrator
- Authentication Administrator
- Billing administrator
- Cloud application administrator
- Conditional Access administrator
- Exchange administrator
- Helpdesk administrator
- Password administrator
- Privileged authentication administrator
- Privileged Role Administrator
- Security administrator
- SharePoint administrator
- User administrator

Organizations can choose to include or exclude roles as they see fit.

## User exclusions

Conditional Access policies are powerful tools, we recommend excluding the following accounts from your policy:

- **Emergency access** or **break-glass** accounts to prevent tenant-wide account lockout. In the unlikely scenario all administrators are locked out of your tenant, your emergency-access administrative account can be used to log into the tenant to take steps to recover access.
   - More information can be found in the article, [Manage emergency access accounts in Azure AD](../roles/security-emergency-access.md).
- **Service accounts** and **service principals**, such as the Azure AD Connect Sync Account. Service accounts are non-interactive accounts that are not tied to any particular user. They are normally used by back-end services allowing programmatic access to applications, but are also used to sign in to systems for administrative purposes. Service accounts like these should be excluded since MFA can't be completed programmatically. Calls made by service principals are not blocked by Conditional Access.
   - If your organization has these accounts in use in scripts or code, consider replacing them with [managed identities](../managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md). As a temporary workaround, you can exclude these specific accounts from the baseline policy.

## Template deployment

Organizations can choose to deploy this policy using the steps outlined below or using the [Conditional Access templates (Preview)](concept-conditional-access-policy-common.md#conditional-access-templates-preview). 

## Create a Conditional Access policy

The following steps will help create a Conditional Access policy to require those assigned administrative roles to perform multi-factor authentication.

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a global administrator, security administrator, or Conditional Access administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users and groups**
   1. Under **Include**, select **Directory roles** and choose built-in roles like:
      - Global administrator
      - Application administrator
      - Authentication Administrator
      - Billing administrator
      - Cloud application administrator
      - Conditional Access administrator
      - Exchange administrator
      - Helpdesk administrator
      - Password administrator
      - Privileged authentication administrator
      - Privileged Role Administrator
      - Security administrator
      - SharePoint administrator
      - User administrator
   
      > [!WARNING]
      > Conditional Access policies support built-in roles. Conditional Access policies are not enforced for other role types including [administrative unit-scoped](../roles/admin-units-assign-roles.md) or [custom roles](../roles/custom-create.md).

   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
   1. Select **Done**.
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**, and select **Done**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require multi-factor authentication**, and select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After confirming your settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), an administrator can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.
