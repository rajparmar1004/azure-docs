# Service Connector region support

When you create a service connection with Service Connector, the conceptual connection resource is provisioned into the same region as your compute service instance by default. This page shows the region support information and corresponding behavior of Service Connector.

## Supported regions with regional endpoint

If your compute service instance is located in one of the regions that Service Connector supports below, you can use Service Connector to create and manage service connections.

- Australia East
- Canada Central
- East Asia
- East US
- East US 2 EUAP
- Germany West Central
- Japan East
- Korea Central
- North Europe
- UK South
- West Central US
- West Europe
- West US 2

## Supported regions with geographical endpoint

Your compute service instance might be created in a region where Service Connector has geographical region support. It means that your service connection will be created in a different region from your compute instance. In such cases, you'll see a banner providing some details about the region when you create a service connection. The region difference may impact your compliance, data residency, and data latency.

## Regions not supported

In regions where Service Connector isn't supported, you'll still find Service Connector CLI commands and the portal node, but you won't be able to create or manage service connections. The product team is working actively to enable more regions.
