New for this release:

- Miscellaneous
  - Extended the disk metrics reported in monitoring dashboards to include more queue length stats and more counters for IOPS. All disks are in scope for data collection that start with `vd` or `sd` now.

- Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance
  - Added buffer cache hit ratio to collectd and surface it in monitoring dashboards.
  - Improvements to the formatting of the legends on some dashboards.
  - Added process level CPU  and memory metrics to the monitoring dashboards for the SQL managed instance process.
  - syncSecondaryToCommit property is now available to be viewed and edited in Azure portal and Azure Data Studio.
  - Added ability to set the DNS name for the readableSecondaries service in Azure CLI and Azure portal.
  - Now collecting the agent.log, security.log and sqlagentstartup.log for Arc-enabled SQL Managed instance to ElasticSearch so they're searchable via Kibana and optionally uploading them to Azure Log Analytics.
  - There are more additional notifications when provisioning new SQL managed instances is blocked due to not exporting/uploading billing data to Azure.

- Data controller
  - Permissions required to deploy the Arc data controller have been reduced to a least-privilege level.
  - When deployed via the Azure CLI, the Arc data controller is now installed via a K8s job that uses a helm chart to do the installation. There's no change to the user experience.
