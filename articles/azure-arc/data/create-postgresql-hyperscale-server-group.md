# Create an Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group from CLI

This document describes the steps to create a PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group on Azure Arc and to connect to it.

[!INCLUDE [azure-arc-common-prerequisites](../../../includes/azure-arc-common-prerequisites.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-arc-data-preview](../../../includes/azure-arc-data-preview.md)]

## Getting started
If you are already familiar with the topics below, you may skip this paragraph.
There are important topics you may want read before you proceed with creation:
- [Overview of Azure Arc-enabled data services](overview.md)
- [Connectivity modes and requirements](connectivity.md)
- [Storage configuration and Kubernetes storage concepts](storage-configuration.md)
- [Kubernetes resource model](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/scheduling/resources.md#resource-quantities)

If you prefer to try out things without provisioning a full environment yourself, get started quickly with [Azure Arc Jumpstart](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_data/) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or in an Azure VM.


## Preliminary and temporary step for OpenShift users only
Implement this step before moving to the next step. To deploy PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group onto Red Hat OpenShift in a project other than the default, you need to execute the following commands against your cluster to update the security constraints. This command grants the necessary privileges to the service accounts that will run your PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group. The security context constraint (SCC) arc-data-scc is the one you added when you deployed the Azure Arc data controller.

```Console
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user arc-data-scc -z <server-group-name> -n <namespace-name>
```

**Server-group-name is the name of the server group you will create during the next step.**

For more details on SCCs in OpenShift, refer to the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html). Proceed to the next step.


## Create an Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group

To create an Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group on your Arc data controller, you will use the command `az postgres arc-server create` to which you will pass several parameters.

For details about all the parameters you can set at the creation time, review the output of the command:
```azurecli
az postgres arc-server create --help
```

The main parameters should consider are:
- **the name of the server group** you want to deploy. Indicate either `--name` or `-n` followed by a name whose length must not exceed 11 characters.

- **the version of the PostgreSQL engine** you want to deploy: by default it is version 12. To deploy version 12, you can either omit this parameter or pass one of the following parameters: `--engine-version 12` or `-ev 12`. To deploy version 11, indicate `--engine-version 11` or `-ev 11`.

- **the number of worker nodes** you want to deploy to scale out and potentially reach better performances. Before proceeding here, read the [concepts about PostgreSQL Hyperscale](concepts-distributed-postgres-hyperscale.md). To indicate the number of worker nodes to deploy, use the parameter `--workers` or `-w` followed by an integer. The table below indicates the range of supported values and what form of Postgres deployment you get with them. For example, if you want to deploy a server group with two worker nodes, indicate `--workers 2` or `-w 2`. This will create three pods, one for the coordinator node/instance and two for the worker nodes/instances (one for each of the workers).



    |You need   |Shape of the server group you will deploy   |`-w` parameter to use   |Note   |
    |---|---|---|---|
    |A scaled out form of Postgres to satisfy the scalability needs of your applications.   |Three or more Postgres instances, one is coordinator, n  are workers with n >=2.   |Use `-w n`, with n>=2.   |The Citus extension that provides the Hyperscale capability is loaded.   |
    |A basic form of PostgreSQL Hyperscale for you to do functional validation of your application at minimum cost. Not valid for performance and scalability validation. For that you need to use the type of deployments described above.   |One Postgres instance that is both coordinator and worker.   |Use `-w 0` and load the Citus extension. Use the following parameters if deploying from command line: `-w 0` --extensions Citus.   |The Citus extension that provides the Hyperscale capability is loaded.   |
    |A simple instance of Postgres that is ready to scale out when you need it.   |One Postgres instance. It is not yet aware of the semantic for coordinator and worker. To scale it out after deployment, edit the configuration, increase the number of worker nodes and distribute the data.   |Use `-w 0` or do not specify `-w`.   |The Citus extension that provides the Hyperscale capability is present on your deployment but is not yet loaded.   |
    |   |   |   |   |

    This table is demonstrated in the following figure:

    :::image type="content" source="media/postgres-hyperscale/deployment-parameters.png" alt-text="Diagram that depicts PostgreSQL Hyperscale worker node parameters and associated architecture." border="false":::

    While using `-w 1` works, we do not recommend you use it. This deployment will not provide you much value. With it, you will get two instances of Postgres: One coordinator and one worker. With this setup, you actually do not scale out the data since you deploy a single worker. As such you will not see an increased level of performance and scalability. We will remove the support of this deployment in a future release.

- **The storage classes** you want your server group to use. It is important you set the storage class right at the time you deploy a server group as this setting cannot be changed after you deploy. You may specify the storage classes to use for the data, logs and the backups. By default, if you do not indicate storage classes, the storage classes of the data controller will be used.
    - To set the storage class for the data, indicate the parameter `--storage-class-data` or `-scd` followed by the name of the storage class.
    - To set the storage class for the logs, indicate the parameter `--storage-class-logs` or `-scl` followed by the name of the storage class.
    - The support of setting storage classes for the backups has been temporarily removed as we temporarily removed the backup/restore functionalities as we finalize designs and experiences.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you need to change the storage class after deployment, extract the data, delete your server group, create a new server group, and import the data. 

When you execute the create command, you will be prompted to enter the password of the default `postgres` administrative user. The name of that user cannot be changed in this Preview. You may skip the interactive prompt by setting the `AZDATA_PASSWORD` session environment variable before you run the create command.

### Examples

**To deploy a server group of Postgres version 12 named postgres01 with two worker nodes that uses the same storage classes as the data controller, run the following command**:

```azurecli
az postgres arc-server create -n postgres01 --workers 2 --k8s-namespace <namespace> --use-k8s
```

> [!NOTE]  
> - If you deployed the data controller using `AZDATA_USERNAME` and `AZDATA_PASSWORD` session environment variables in the same terminal session, then the values for `AZDATA_PASSWORD` will be used to deploy the PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group too. If you prefer to use another password, either (1) update the value for `AZDATA_PASSWORD` or (2) delete the `AZDATA_PASSWORD` environment variable or (3) delete its value to be prompted to enter a password interactively when you create a server group.
> - Creating a PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group will not immediately register resources in Azure. As part of the process of uploading [resource inventory](upload-metrics-and-logs-to-azure-monitor.md)  or [usage data](view-billing-data-in-azure.md) to Azure, the resources will be created in Azure and you will be able to see your resources in the Azure portal.


## List the PostgreSQL Hyperscale server groups deployed in your Arc data controller

To list the PostgreSQL Hyperscale server groups deployed in your Arc data controller, run the following command:

```azurecli
az postgres arc-server list --k8s-namespace <namespace> --use-k8s
```


```output
  {
    "name": "postgres01",
    "replicas": 1,
    "state": "Ready",
    "workers": 2
  }
```

## Get the endpoints to connect to your Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale server groups

To view the endpoints for a PostgreSQL server group, run the following command:

```azurecli
az postgres arc-server endpoint list -n <server group name> --k8s-namespace <namespace> --use-k8s
```
For example:
```console
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "endpoints": [
        {
          "description": "PostgreSQL Instance",
          "endpoint": "postgresql://postgres:<replace with password>@123.456.78.912:5432"
        },
        {
          "description": "Log Search Dashboard",
        },
        {
          "description": "Metrics Dashboard",
          "endpoint": "https://98.765.432.11:3000/d/postgres-metrics?var-Namespace=arc&var-Name=postgres01"
        }
      ],
      "engine": "PostgreSql",
      "name": "postgres01"
    }
  ],
  "namespace": "arc"
}
```

You can use the PostgreSQL Instance endpoint to connect to the PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group from your favorite tool:  [Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio), [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) psql, pgAdmin, etc. When you do so, you connect to the coordinator node/instance, which takes care of routing the query to the appropriate worker nodes/instances if you have created distributed tables. For more details, read the [concepts of Azure Arc-enabled PostgreSQL Hyperscale](concepts-distributed-postgres-hyperscale.md).

   [!INCLUDE [use-insider-azure-data-studio](includes/use-insider-azure-data-studio.md)]

## Special note about Azure virtual machine deployments

When you are using an Azure virtual machine, then the endpoint IP address will not show the _public_ IP address. To locate the public IP address, use the following command:
```azurecli
az network public-ip list -g azurearcvm-rg --query "[].{PublicIP:ipAddress}" -o table
```
You can then combine the public IP address with the port to make your connection.

You may also need to expose the port of the PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group through the network security gateway (NSG). To allow traffic through the (NSG), set a rule. To set a rule, you will need to know the name of your NSG. You determine the NSG using the command below:

```azurecli
az network nsg list -g azurearcvm-rg --query "[].{NSGName:name}" -o table
```

Once you have the name of the NSG, you can add a firewall rule using the following command. The example values here create an NSG rule for port 30655 and allows connection from **any** source IP address. 

> [!WARNING]
> We do not recommend setting a rule to allow connection from any source IP address. You can lock down things better by specifying a `-source-address-prefixes` value that is specific to your client IP address or an IP address range that covers your team's or organization's IP addresses.

Replace the value of the `--destination-port-ranges` parameter below with the port number you got from the `az postgres arc-server list` command above.

```azurecli
az network nsg rule create -n db_port --destination-port-ranges 30655 --source-address-prefixes '*' --nsg-name azurearcvmNSG --priority 500 -g azurearcvm-rg --access Allow --description 'Allow port through for db access' --destination-address-prefixes '*' --direction Inbound --protocol Tcp --source-port-ranges '*'
```

## Connect with Azure Data Studio

Open Azure Data Studio and connect to your instance with the external endpoint IP address and port number above, and the password you specified at the time you created the instance.  If PostgreSQL isn't available in the *Connection type* dropdown, you can install the PostgreSQL extension by searching for PostgreSQL in the extensions tab.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to click the [Advanced] button in the connection panel to enter the port number.

Remember, if you are using an Azure VM you will need the _public_ IP address, which is accessible via the following command:

```azurecli
az network public-ip list -g azurearcvm-rg --query "[].{PublicIP:ipAddress}" -o table
```

## Connect with psql

To access your PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group, pass the external endpoint of the PostgreSQL Hyperscale server group that you retrieved from above:

You can now connect either psql:

```console
psql postgresql://postgres:<EnterYourPassword>@10.0.0.4:30655
```
