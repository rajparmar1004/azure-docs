# Which appliances do I need?

This article is designed to help you choose the right OT appliances for your sensors and on-premises management consoles. Use the tables below to understand which hardware profile best fits your organization's network monitoring needs.

You can use both physical or virtual appliances.

## C5600: IT/OT mixed environments

Use the following hardware profiles for high bandwidth corporate IT/OT mixed networks:

|Hardware profile  |Max throughput |Max monitored Assets  |Deployment |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|C5600   | 3 Gbps        | 12 K        |Physical / Virtual         |

## E1800, E1000, E500:  monitoring at the site level

Use the following  hardware profiles for enterprise monitoring at the site level:

|Hardware profile  |Max throughput  |Max monitored assets  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|E1800    |1 Gbps         |10K         |Physical / Virtual         |
|E1000    |1 Gbps         |10K         |Physical / Virtual         |
|E500    |1 Gbps         |10K         |Physical / Virtual         |

## Production line monitoring

Use the following hardware profiles for production line monitoring:

|Hardware profile  |Max throughput  |Max monitored assets  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|L500   | 200 Mbps        |   1,000      |Physical / Virtual         |
|L100    | 60 Mbps        |   800      | Physical / Virtual        |
|L64    | 10 Mbps        |   100      |Physical / Virtual|

## On-premises management console systems

On-premises management consoles allow you to manage and monitor large, multiple-sensor deployments. Use the following hardware profiles for deployment of an on-premises management console:

|Hardware profile  |Max monitored sensors  |Deployment  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|E1800    |Up to 300         |Physical / Virtual         |

## Next steps

Continue understanding system requirements, including options for ordering pre-configured appliances, or required specifications to install software on your own appliances:

- [Pre-configured physical appliances for OT monitoring](ot-pre-configured-appliances.md)
- [Resource requirements for virtual appliances](ot-virtual-appliances.md)

Then, use any of the following procedures to continue:

- [Purchase sensors or download software for sensors](onboard-sensors.md#purchase-sensors-or-download-software-for-sensors)
- [Download software for an on-premises management console](how-to-manage-the-on-premises-management-console.md#download-software-for-the-on-premises-management-console)
- [Install software](how-to-install-software.md)

Reference articles for OT monitoring appliances also include installation procedures in case you need to install software on your own appliances, or reinstall software on preconfigured appliances.
