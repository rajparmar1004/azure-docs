   | **configure an IP address for the sensor monitoring interface** | Enter an IP address |
   | **configure a subnet mask for the sensor monitoring interface** | Enter an IP address |

1. Accept the settings and continue by typing `Y`.

1. After about 10 minutes, the two sets of credentials appear. One is for a **CyberX** user, and one is for a **Support** user.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/credentials-screen.png" alt-text="Copy these credentials as they won't be presented again.":::

   Save the usernames and passwords, you'll need these credentials to access the platform the first time you use it.

1. Select **Enter** to continue.

For information on how to find the physical port on your appliance, see [Find your port](#find-your-port).

### Add a secondary NIC (optional)

You can enhance security to your on-premises management console by adding a secondary NIC dedicated for attached sensors within an IP address range. When you use a secondary NIC, the first is dedicated for end-users, and the secondary supports the configuration of a gateway for routed networks.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/secondary-nic.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the overall architecture of the secondary NIC." border="false":::

Both NICs will support the user interface (UI). If you choose not to deploy a secondary NIC, all of the features will be available through the primary NIC.

This procedure describes how to add a secondary NIC if you've already installed your on-premises management console.

**To add a secondary NIC**:

1. Use the network reconfigure command:

    ```bash
    sudo cyberx-management-network-reconfigure
    ```

1. Enter the following responses to the following questions:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/network-reconfig-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the required answers to configure your appliance. ":::

    | Parameters | Response to enter |
    |--|--|
    | **Management Network IP address** | `N` |
    | **Subnet mask** | `N` |
    | **DNS** | `N` |
    | **Default gateway IP Address** | `N` |
    | **Sensor monitoring interface** <br>Optional. Relevant when sensors are on a different network segment.| `Y`, and select a possible value |
    | **An IP address for the sensor monitoring interface** | `Y`, and enter an IP address that's  accessible by the sensors|
    | **A subnet mask for the sensor monitoring interface** | `Y`, and enter an IP address that's  accessible by the sensors|
    | **Hostname** | Enter the hostname |

1. Review all choices and enter `Y` to accept the changes. The system reboots.

### Find your port

If you're having trouble locating the physical port on your device, you can use the following command to find your port:

```bash
sudo ethtool -p <port value> <time-in-seconds>
```

This command will cause the light on the port to flash for the specified time period. For example, entering `sudo ethtool -p eno1 120`, will have port eno1 flash for 2 minutes, allowing you to find the port on the back of your appliance.

## Post-installation validation

After you've finished installing OT monitoring software on your appliance, test your system to make sure that processes are running correctly. The same validation process applies to all appliance types.

System health validations are supported via the sensor or on-premises management console UI or CLI, and are available for both the **Support** and **CyberX** users.

After installing OT monitoring software, make sure to run the following tests:

- **Sanity test**: Verify that the system is running.

- **Version**: Verify that the version is correct.

- **ifconfig**: Verify that all the input interfaces configured during the installation process are running.

For more information, see [Check system health](how-to-troubleshoot-the-sensor-and-on-premises-management-console.md#check-system-health) in our sensor and on-premises management console troubleshooting article.

## Configure tunneling access for sensors through the on-premises management console

Enhance system security by preventing direct user access to the sensor.

Instead of direct access, use proxy tunneling to let users access the sensor from the on-premises management console with a single firewall rule. This technique narrows the possibility of unauthorized access to the network environment beyond the sensor. The user's experience when signing in to the sensor remains the same.

When tunneling access is configured, users use the following URL syntax to access their sensor consoles: `https://<on-premises management console address>/<sensor address>/<page URL>`

For example, the following image shows a sample architecture where users access the sensor consoles via the on-premises management console.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-install-components/sensor-system-graph.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows access to the sensor." border="false":::

The interface between the IT firewall, on-premises management console, and the OT firewall is done using a reverse proxy with URL rewrites. The interface between the OT firewall and the sensors is done using reverse SSH tunnels.

**To enable tunneling access for sensors**:

1. Sign in to the on-premises management console's CLI with the **CyberX** or the **Support** user credentials.

1. Enter `sudo cyberx-management-tunnel-enable`.

1. Select **Enter**.

1. Enter `--port 10000`.
