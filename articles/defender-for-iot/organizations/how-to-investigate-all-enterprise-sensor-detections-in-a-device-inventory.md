# Manage your OT device inventory from an on-premises management console

Use the **Device inventory** page from an on-premises management console to manage all OT and IT devices detected by sensors connected to that console. Identify new devices detected, devices that might need troubleshooting, and more.

For more information, see [What is a Defender for IoT committed device?](architecture.md#what-is-a-defender-for-iot-committed-device).


> [!TIP]
> Alternately, view your device inventory from a [the Azure portal](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md), or from an [OT sensor console](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md).
>

## View the device inventory

To view detected devices in the **Device Inventory** page in an on-premises management console, sign-in to your on-premises management console, and then select **Device Inventory**. 

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/device-inventory-data-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the on-premises management console Device Inventory page." lightbox="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/device-inventory-data-table.png":::

Use any of the following options to modify or filter the devices shown:

|Option  |Steps  |
|---------|---------|
| **Sort devices** | To sort the grid by a specific column, select the **Sort** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/alphabetical-order-icon.png" border="false"::: button in the column you want to sort by. Use the arrow buttons that appear to sort ascending or descending. |
|**Filter devices shown**    |  1. In the column that you want to filter, select the **Filter** button :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/filter-a-column-icon.png" border="false":::.<br>2. In the **Filter** box, define your filter value.  <br><br>Filters aren't saved when you refresh the **Device Inventory** page. |
| **Save a filter** | To save the current set of filters, select the **Save As** button that appears in the filter row.|
| **Load a saved filter** | Saved filters are listed on the left, in the **Groups** pane. <br><br>1. Select the **Options** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/options-menu.png"border="false"::: button in the toolbar to display the **Groups** pane. <br>2. In the **Device Inventory Filters** list, select the saved filter you want to load.  |

For more information, see [Device inventory column reference](#device-inventory-column-reference).

## Export the device inventory to CSV

Export your device inventory to a CSV file to manage or share data outside of the OT sensor.

To export device inventory data, select the **Import/Export file** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon-device-inventory.png" border="false"::: button, and then select one of the following:

- **Export Device Inventory View**: Exports only the devices currently displayed, with the current filter applied
- **Export All Device Inventory**: Exports the entire device inventory, with no filtering

Save the exported file locally.

## Enhance device inventory data

Enhance the data in your device inventory with information from other sources, such as CMDBs, DNS, firewalls, and Web APIs. Use enhanced data to learn things such as:

- Device purchase dates and end-of-warranty dates
- Users responsible for each device
- Opened tickets for devices
- The last date when the firmware was upgraded
- Devices allowed access to the internet
- Devices running active antivirus applications
- Users signed in to devices

Enhancement data is shown as extra columns in the on-premises management console **Device inventory** page.

Enhance data by adding it manually or by running customized scripts from Defender for IoT. You can also work with Defender for IoT support to set up your system to receive Web API queries.

For example, the following image shows an example of how you might use enhanced data in the device inventory:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/enterprise-data-integrator-graph.png" alt-text="Diagram of the data integrator.":::

# [Add data manually](#tab/manually)

To enhance your data manually:

1. Sign in to your on-premises management console, and select **Device inventory**.

1. On the top-right, select the **Settings** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon.png" border="false"::: button to open the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog.

1. In the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog box, select **ADD CUSTOM COLUMN**.

1. In the **Add Custom Column** dialog box, add the new column name using up to 250 UTF characters.

1. Select **Manual** > **SAVE**. The new item appears in the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog box.

1. In the upper-right corner of the **Device Inventory** window, select the **Import/Export file** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon-device-inventory.png" border="false"::: button > **Export All Device Inventory**.

    A CSV file is generated with the data displayed.

1. Download and open the CSV file for editing, and manually add your information to the new column.

1. Back in the **Device inventory** page, at the top-right, select the **Import/Export file** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon-device-inventory.png" border="false"::: button again > **Import Manual Input Columns**. Browse to and select your edited CSV file.

The new data appears in the **Device Inventory** grid.

# [Add data using automation](#tab/automation)

To enhance your data using automation scripts:

1. Contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=82c88f35-1b8e-f274-ec11-c6efdd6dd099) to obtain the relevant scripts.

1. Sign in to your on-premises management console, and select **Device inventory**.

1. On the side, select the **Settings** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-work-with-asset-inventory-information/menu-icon.png" border="false"::: button to open the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog.

1. In the **Device Inventory Settings** dialog box, select **ADD CUSTOM COLUMN**.

1. In the **Add Custom Column** dialog box, add the new column name using up to 250 UTF characters.

1. Select **Automatic**. When the **UPLOAD SCRIPT** and **TEST SCRIPT** buttons appear, upload and then test the script you'd received from [Microsoft Support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=82c88f35-1b8e-f274-ec11-c6efdd6dd099).

The new data appears in the **Device Inventory** grid.

## Retrieve device inventory data via API

You can retrieve an extensive range of device information detected by managed sensors and integrate that information with partner systems.

For example:

1. Retrieve sensor, zone, site ID, IP address, MAC address, firmware, protocol, and vendor information.

1. Filter that information based on any of the following values:

    - Authorized and unauthorized devices.

    - Devices associated with specific sites.

    - Devices associated with specific zones.

    - Devices associated with specific sensors.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT sensor and management console APIs](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-apis.md).
