# Manage your device inventory from the Azure portal

Use the **Device inventory** page in the Azure portal to manage all network devices detected by cloud-connected sensors, including OT, IoT, and IT. Identify new devices detected, devices that might need troubleshooting, and more.

For more information, see [What is a Defender for IoT committed device?](architecture.md#what-is-a-defender-for-iot-committed-device).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Device inventory** page in Defender for IoT on the Azure portal is in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include other legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>
> Alternately, view device inventory from a [specific sensor console](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md), or from an [on-premises management console](how-to-investigate-all-enterprise-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md).

## View the device inventory

This procedure describes how to view detected devices in the **Device inventory** page in the Azure portal.

1. In Defender for IoT in the Azure portal, select **Device inventory**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/device-inventory.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Device inventory page in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/device-inventory.png":::

    Use any of the following options to modify or filter the devices shown:

    |Option  |Steps  |
    |---------|---------|
    | **Sort devices** | Select a column header to sort the devices by that column. Select it again to change the sort direction. |
    |**Filter devices shown**    |   Either use the **Search** box to search for specific device details, or select **Add filter** to filter the devices shown. <br><br>In the **Add filter** box, define your filter by column name, operator, and value. Select **Apply** to apply your filter.<br><br>You can apply multiple filters at the same time. Search results and filters aren't saved when you refresh the **Device inventory** page.|
    |**Modify columns shown**     |   Select **Edit columns** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/edit-columns-icon.png" border="false":::. In the **Edit columns** pane:<br><br>        - Select the **+ Add Column** button to add new columns to the grid.<br>        - Drag and drop fields to change the columns order.<br>- To remove a column, select the **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/trashcan-icon.png" border="false"::: icon to the right.<br>- To reset the columns to their default settings, select **Reset** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/reset-icon.png" border="false":::.   <br><br>Select **Save** to save any changes made.  |
    | **Group devices** | From the **Group by** above the gird, select either **Type** or **Class** to group the devices shown. Inside each group, devices retain the same column sorting. To remove the grouping, select **No grouping**. |

1. Select a device row to view more details about that device. Initial details are shown in a pane on the right, where you can also select **View full details** to drill down more.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/device-information-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a device details pane and the View full details button in the Azure portal." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/device-information-window.png":::

For more information, see [Device inventory column reference](#device-inventory-column-reference).

### Identify devices that aren't connecting successfully

If you suspect that certain devices aren't actively communicating with Azure, we recommend that you verify whether those devices have communicated with Azure recently at all. For example:

1. In the **Device inventory** page, make sure that the **Last activity** column is shown.

    Select **Edit columns** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/edit-columns-icon.png" border="false"::: > **Add column** > **Last Activity** > **Save**.

1. Select the **Last activity** column to sort the grid by that column.

1. Filter the grid to show active devices during a specific time period:

    1. Select **Add filter**.
    1. In the **Column** field, select **Last activity**.
    1. Select a predefined time range, or define a custom range to filter for.
    1. Select **Apply**.

1. Search for the devices you're verifying in the filtered list of devices.

## Edit device details

As you manage your network devices, you may need to update their details. For example, you may want to modify security value as assets change, or personalize the inventory to better identify devices, or if a device was classified incorrectly.

**To edit device details**:

1. Select one or more devices in the grid, and then select **Edit** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/edit-device-details.png" border="false":::.

1. If you've selected multiple devices, select **Add field type** and add the fields you want to edit, for all selected devices.

1. Modify the device fields as needed, and then select **Save** when you're done.

Your updates are saved for all selected devices.

For more information, see [Device inventory column reference](#device-inventory-column-reference).

### Reference of editable fields

The following device fields are supported for editing in the **Device inventory** page:

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
| **General information** | |
|**Name** | Mandatory. Supported for editing only when editing a single device. |
|**Authorized Device**     |Toggle on or off as needed as device security changes.         |
|**Description**     |  Enter a meaningful description for the device.       |
|**Location**     |   Enter a meaningful location for the device.      |
|**Category**     | Use the **Class**, **Type**, and **Subtype** options to categorize the device.         |
|**Business Function**     | Enter a meaningful description of the device's business function.        |
|**Hardware Model**     |   Select the device's hardware model from the dropdown menu.      |
|**Hardware Vendor**     | Select the device's hardware vendor from the dropdown menu.        |
|**Firmware**      |   Device the device's firmware name and version. You can either select the **delete** button to delete an existing firmware definition, or select **+ Add** to add a new one.  |
|**Tags**     | Enter meaningful tags for the device. Select the **delete**  button to delete an existing tag, or select **+ Add** to add a new one.         |
| **Settings** |
|**Importance**     | Select **Low**, **Normal**, or **High** to modify the device's importance.        |
|**Programming device**     | Toggle the **Programming Device** option on or off as needed for your device.        |

For more information, see [Device inventory column reference](#device-inventory-column-reference).

## Export the device inventory to CSV

Export your device inventory to a CSV file to manage or share data outside of the Azure portal. You can export a maximum of 30,000 devices at a time.

**To export device inventory data**:

On the **Device inventory page**, select **Export** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/export-button.png" border="false":::.

The device inventory is exported with any filters currently applied, and you can save the file locally.


## Delete a device

If you have devices no longer in use, delete them from the device inventory so that they're no longer connected to Defender for IoT.

Devices might be inactive because of misconfigured SPAN ports, changes in network coverage, or because the device was unplugged from the network.

Delete inactive devices to maintain a correct representation of current network activity, better understand your committed devices when managing your Defender for IoT plans, and to reduce clutter on your screen.

**To delete a device**:

In the **Device inventory** page, select the device you want to delete, and then select **Delete** :::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-manage-device-inventory-on-the-cloud/delete-device.png" border="false"::: in the toolbar at the top of the page.

At the prompt, select **Yes** to confirm that you want to delete the device from Defender for IoT.
