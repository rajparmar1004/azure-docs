# Pre-configured physical appliances for OT monitoring

This article provides a catalog of the pre-configured appliances available for Microsoft Defender for IoT OT sensors and on-premises management consoles.

Use the links in the tables below to jump to articles with more details about each appliance.

Microsoft has partnered with [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/) to provide pre-configured sensors. To purchase a pre-configured sensor, contact Arrow at: [hardware.sales@arrow.com](mailto:hardware.sales@arrow.com).

For more information, see [Purchase sensors or download software for sensors](onboard-sensors.md#purchase-sensors-or-download-software-for-sensors).


## Advantages of preconfigured appliances

Pre-configured physical appliances have been validated for Defender for IoT OT system monitoring, and have the following advantages over installing your own software:

- **Performance** over the total assets monitored
- **Compatibility** with new Defender for IoT releases, with validations for upgrades and driver support
- **Stability**, validated physical appliances undergo traffic monitoring and packet loss tests
- **In-lab experience**, Microsoft support teams train using validated physical appliances and have a working knowledge of the hardware
- **Availability**, components are selected to offer long-term worldwide availability

## Appliances for OT network sensors
