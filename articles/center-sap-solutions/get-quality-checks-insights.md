# Get quality checks and insights for a Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview content notice](./includes/preview.md)]

The *Quality Insights* Azure workbook in *Azure Center for SAP solutions (ACSS)* provides insights about the SAP system resources. The feature is part of the monitoring capabilities built in to the *Virtual Instance for SAP solutions (VIS)*. These quality checks make sure that your SAP system uses Azure and SAP best practices for reliability and performance. 

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to use quality checks and insights to get more information about virtual machine (VM) configurations within your SAP system.

## Prerequisites

- An SAP system that you've [created with ACSS](deploy-s4hana.md) or [registered with ACSS](register-existing-system.md). 

## Open Quality Insights workbook

To open the workbook:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for and select **Azure Center for SAP solutions** in the Azure portal search bar.
1. On the **Azure Center for SAP solutions** page's sidebar menu, select **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions**.
1. On the **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions** page, select the VIS that you want to get insights about.

1. On the sidebar menu for the VIS, under **Monitoring** select **Quality Insights**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/get-quality-checks-insights/quality-insights.png" lightbox="media/get-quality-checks-insights/quality-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure portal, showing the Quality Insights workbook page selected in the sidebar menu for a virtual Instance for SAP solutions.":::

There are multiple sections in the workbook:
- Select the default **Advisor Recommendations** tab to [see the list of recommendations made by ACSS for the different instances in your VIS](#get-advisor-recommendations)
- Select the **Virtual Machine** tab to [find information about the VMs in your VIS](#get-vm-information)
- Select the **Configuration Checks** tab to [see configuration checks for your VIS](#run-configuration-checks)

## Get Advisor Recommendations

The **Quality checks** feature in ACSS runs validation checks for all VIS resources. These quality checks validate the SAP system configurations follow the best practices recommended by SAP and Azure. If a VIS doesn't follow these best practices, you receive a recommendation from Azure Advisor.

The table in the **Advisor Recommendations** tab shows all the recommendations for ASCS, Application and Database instances in the VIS.

:::image type="content" source="media/get-quality-checks-insights/advisor-recommendation.png" lightbox="media/get-quality-checks-insights/advisor-recommendation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Advisor Recommendations tab, showing overview of recommendations for all instances in the VIS.":::

Select an instance name to see all recommendations, including which action to take to resolve an issue.

The following checks are run for each VIS:

- Checks that the VMs used for different instances in the VIS are certified by SAP. For better performance and support, make sure that a VM is certified for SAP on Azure. For more details, see [SAP note 1928533] (https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533).
- Checks that accelerated networking is enabled for the NICs attached to the different VMs. Network latency between Application VMs and Database VMs for SAP workloads must be 0.7 ms or less. If accelerated networking isn't enabled, network latency can increase beyond the threshold of 0.7 ms. For more details, see the [planning and deployment checklist for SAP workloads on Azure](../virtual-machines/workloads/sap/sap-deployment-checklist.md).
- Checks that the network configuration is optimized for HANA and the OS. Makes sure that as many client ports as possible are available for HANA internal communication. You must explicitly exclude the ports used by processes and applications which bind to specific ports by adjusting the parameter `net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports` to a range of 9000-64999. For more details, see [SAP note 2382421](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2382421).
- Checks that swap space is set to 2 GB in HANA systems. For SLES and RHEL, configure a small swap space of 2 GB to avoid performance regressions at times of high memory utilization in the OS. Typically, it's recommended that activities terminate with "out of memory" errors. This setting makes sure that the overall system is still usable and only certain requests are terminated. For more details, see [SAP note 1999997](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1999997).
- Checks that **fstrim** is disabled in SAP systems that run on SUSE OS. **fstrim** scans the filesystem and sends `UNMAP` commands for each unused block found. This setting is useful in a thin-provisioned system, if the system is over-provisioned. It's not recommended to run SAP HANA on an over-provisioned storage array. Active **fstrim** can cause XFS metadata corruption. For more information, see [SAP note 2205917](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2205917) and [Disabling fstrim - under which conditions?](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019447).


> [!NOTE]
> These quality checks run on all VIS instances at a regular frequency of 12 hours. The corresponding recommendations in Azure Advisor also refresh at the same 12-hour frequency.

If you take action on one or more recommendations from ACSS, wait for the next refresh to see any new recommendations from Azure Advisor.

## Get VM information

The **Virtual Machine** tab provides insights about the VMs in your VIS. There are multiple subsections:

- [Azure Compute](#azure-compute)
- [Compute List](#compute-list)
- [Compute Extensions](#compute-extensions)
- [Compute + OS Disk](#compute--os-disk)
- [Compute + Data Disks](#compute--data-disks)

### Azure Compute

The **Azure Compute** tab shows a summary graph of the VMs inside the VIS.

#### Load Balancer Overview

The **Load Balancer Overview** tab shows rules and details for the load balancers in the VIS. You can review:

- If the HA ports are defined for the load balancers.
- If the load balancers have floating IP addresses enabled.
- If the keep-alive functionality is enabled, with a maximum timeout of 30 minutes.
