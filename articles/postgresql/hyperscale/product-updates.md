## Features in preview

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Hyperscale (Citus) offers
previews for unreleased features. Preview versions are provided
without a service level agreement, and aren't recommended for
production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or
might have constrained capabilities.  For more information, see
[Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure
Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)

Here are the features currently available for preview:

* **[pgAudit](concepts-audit.md)**. Provides detailed
  session and object audit logging via the standard PostgreSQL
  logging facility. It produces audit logs required to pass
  certain government, financial, or ISO certification audits.
* **[Cross-region
  replication](concepts-read-replicas.md#cross-region-replication-preview)**.
  Create asynchronous read replicas for a server group in different regions.
