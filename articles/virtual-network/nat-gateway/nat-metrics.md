## How to use NAT gateway metrics

### Bytes

The **Bytes** metric shows you the amount of data going outbound through NAT gateway and returning inbound in response to an outbound connection. 

Use this metric for the following measurements:

- Assess the amount of data being processed through NAT gateway to connect outbound or return inbound.

To view the amount of data sent in one or both directions when connecting outbound through NAT gateway:

1. Select the NAT gateway resource you would like to monitor. 

2. In the **Metric** drop-down menu, select the **Bytes** metric. 

3. In the **Aggregation** drop-down menu, select **Sum**.

4. Select to **Add filter**.

5. In the **Property** drop-down menu, select **Direction (Out | In)**.

6. In the **Values** drop-down menu, select **Out**, **In**, or both. 

7. To see data processed inbound or outbound as their own individual lines in the metric graph, select **Apply splitting**. 

8.  In the **Values** drop-down menu, select **Direction (Out | In)**.

### Packets

The packets metric shows you the number of data packets transmitted through the NAT gateway. 

Use this metric to:
  
- To confirm that traffic is being sent through your NAT gateway to go outbound to the internet or return inbound. 

- To assess the amount of traffic being directed through your NAT gateway resource outbound or inbound (when in response to an outbound directed flow). 

To view the number of packets sent in one or both directions when connecting outbound through NAT gateway, follow the same steps in the [Bytes](#bytes) section. 

### Dropped packets

The dropped packets metric shows you the number of data packets dropped by NAT gateway when directing traffic outbound or inbound in response to an outbound connection. 

Use this metric to: 

- Assess whether or not you're nearing or possibly experiencing SNAT exhaustion with a given NAT gateway resource. Check to see if periods of dropped packets coincide with periods of failed SNAT connections with the [Total SNAT Connection Count](#total-snat-connection-count) metric. 

- Help assess if you're experiencing a pattern of failed outbound connections. 

Reasons for why you may see dropped packets: 

- If you're seeing a high rate of dropped packets, it may be due to outbound connectivity failure. Connectivity failure may happen for various reasons. See the NAT gateway [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshoot-nat.md) to help you further diagnose. 

### SNAT connection count

The SNAT connection count metric shows you the number of newly used SNAT ports within a specified time frame. 

Use this metric to: 

- Evaluate the number of successful and failed attempts to make outbound connections.

- Help assess if you're experiencing a pattern of failed outbound connections. 

To view the number of attempted and failed connections:

1. Select the NAT gateway resource you would like to monitor. 

2. In the **Metric** drop-down menu, select the **SNAT Connection Count** metric.

3. In the **Aggregation** drop-down menu, select **Sum**. 

4. Select to **Add filter**.

5. In the **Property** drop-down menu, select **Connection State**.

6. In the **Values** drop-down menu, select **Attempted**, **Failed**, or both.

7. To see attempted and failed connections as their own individual lines in the metric graph, select **Apply splitting**.

8. In the **Values** drop-down menu, select **Connection State**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/nat-metrics/nat-metrics-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the metrics configuration.":::

Reasons for why you may see failed connections:

- If you're seeing a pattern of failed connections for your NAT gateway resource, there could be multiple possible reasons. See the NAT gateway [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshoot-nat.md) to help you further diagnose.  

### Total SNAT connection count

The **Total SNAT connection count** metric shows you the total number of active SNAT connections over a period of time. 

You can use this metric to:

- Monitor SNAT port utilization on a given NAT gateway resource. 

- Analyze over a given time interval to provide insight on whether or not NAT gateway connectivity should be scaled out further by adding more public IPs. 

- Assess whether or not you're nearing or possibly experiencing SNAT exhaustion with a given NAT gateway resource.

### Data path availability (Preview)

The data path availability metric measures the status of the NAT gateway resource over time. This metric informs on whether or not NAT gateway is available for directing outbound traffic to the internet. This metric is a reflection of the health of the Azure infrastructure. 

You can use this metric to: 

- Monitor the availability of your NAT gateway resource.

- Investigate the platform where your NAT gateway is deployed and determine if itâ€™s healthy. 

- Isolate whether an event is related to your NAT gateway or to the underlying data plane. 

Reasons for why you may see a drop in data path availability include: 

- An infrastructure outage has occurred. 

- There aren't healthy VMs available in your NAT gateway configured subnet. For more information, see the NAT gateway [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshoot-nat.md). 

## Alerts

Alerts can be configured in Azure Monitor for each of the preceding metrics. These alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address potential issues with your NAT gateway resource. 

For more information about how metric alerts work, see [Azure Monitor Metric Alerts](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview.md). See guidance below on how to configure some common and recommended types of alerts for your NAT gateway. 

### Alerts for data path availability droppage

If the datapath of your NAT gateway resource begins to experience drops in availability, you can set up an alert to be fired when it hits a specific threshold in availability. 

The recommended guidance is to alert on NAT gatewayâ€™s datapath availability when it drops below 90% over a 15 minute period. This configuration will be indicative of a NAT gateway resource going into a degraded state.

To set up a datapath availability alert, follow these steps:

1. From the NAT gateway resource page, select **Alerts**. 

2. Select **Create alert rule**. 

3. From the signal list, select **Datapath Availability**. 

4. From the **Operator** drop-down menu, select **Less than**. 

5. From the **Aggregation type** drop-down menu, select **Average**. 

6. In the **Threshold value** box, enter **90%** as the value that the datapath availability must drop below before an alert is fired.

7. From the **Unit** drop-down menu, select **Count**. 

8. From the **Aggregation granularity (Period)** drop-down menu, select **15 minutes**. 

9. Create an **Action** for your alert by providing a name, notification type, and type of action that is performed when the alert is triggered.

10. Before deploying your action, **test the action group**.

11. Select **Create** to create the alert rule.

>[!NOTE]
>Aggregation granularity is the period of time over which the datapath availability is measured to determine if it has dropped below the threshold value. 
Setting the aggregation granularity to less than 5 minutes may trigger false positive alerts that detect noise in the datapath.

### Alerts for SNAT port usage

Use the total **SNAT connection count** metric and alerts for when you're nearing the limits of available SNAT ports. 

To create the alert, use the following steps:

1. From the NAT gateway resource page, select **Alerts**. 

2. Select **Create alert rule**. 

3. From the signal list, select **Total SNAT Connection Count**. 

4. From the **Operator** drop-down menu, select **Less than or equal to**. 

5. From the **Aggregation type** drop-down menu, select **Total**. 

6. In the **Threshold value** box, enter a percentage value that the Total SNAT connection count must drop below before an alert is fired. When deciding what threshold value to use, keep in mind how much you've scaled out your NAT gateway outbound connectivity with public IP addresses. For more information, see [Scale NAT gateway](./nat-gateway-resource.md#scale-nat-gateway). 

7. From the **Unit** drop-down menu, select **Count**. 

8. From the **Aggregation granularity (Period)** drop-down menu, select a time period over which you would like the SNAT connection count to be measured. 

9. Create an **Action** for your alert by providing a name, notification type, and type of action that is performed when the alert is triggered.

10. Before deploying your action, **test the action group**.

11. Select **Create** to create the alert rule.

>[!NOTE]
>SNAT exhaustion on your NAT gateway resource is uncommon. If you see SNAT exhaustion, your NAT gateway's idle timeout timer may be holding on to SNAT ports too long or your may need to scale with additional public IPs. To troubleshoot these kinds of issues, refer to the NAT gateway [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshoot-nat.md). 

## Network Insights

[Azure Monitor Network Insights](../../azure-monitor/insights/network-insights-overview.md) allows you to visualize your Azure infrastructure setup and to review all metrics for your NAT gateway resource from a pre-configured metrics dashboard. These visual tools help you diagnose and troubleshoot any issues with your NAT gateway resource. 

### View the topology of your Azure architectural setup

To view a topological map of your setup in Azure:

1. From your NAT gatewayâ€™s resource page, select **Insights** from the **Monitoring** section.

2. On the landing page for **Insights**, you'll see a topology map of your NAT gateway setup. This map will show you the relationship between the different components of your network (subnets, virtual machines, public IP addresses). 

3. Hover over any component in the topology map to view configuration information.
