# Limitations and known issues with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) support for Azure Blob Storage (preview)

This article describes limitations and known issues of SFTP support for Azure Blob Storage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SFTP support is currently in PREVIEW and is available on general-purpose v2 and premium block blob accounts. Complete [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/gZguN0j65Y) BEFORE using the feature in preview. Registration via 'preview features' is NOT required and confirmation email will NOT be sent after filling out the form. You can IMMEDIATELY access the feature.
>
> After testing your end-to-end scenarios with SFTP, please share your experience via [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/MgjezFV1NR).
> 
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because you must enable hierarchical namespace for your account to use SFTP, all of the known issues that are described in the Known issues with [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](data-lake-storage-known-issues.md) article also apply to your account.

## Known unsupported clients

The following clients are known to be incompatible with SFTP for Azure Blob Storage (preview). See [Supported algorithms](secure-file-transfer-protocol-support.md#supported-algorithms) for more information.

- Five9
- Kemp
- Mule
- paramiko 1.16.0
- SSH.NET 2016.1.0

The unsupported client list above is not exhaustive and may change over time.

## Unsupported operations

| Category | Unsupported operations |
|---|---|
| ACLs | <li>`chgrp` - change group<li>`chmod` - change permissions/mode<li>`chown` - change owner<li>`put/get -p` - preserving permissions |
| Resume operations |<li>`reget`, `get -a`- resume download<li>`reput`. `put -a` - resume upload |
| Random writes and appends | <li>Operations that include both READ and WRITE flags. For example: [SSH.NET create API](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/blob/develop/src/Renci.SshNet/SftpClient.cs#:~:text=public%20SftpFileStream-,Create,-(string%20path))<li>Operations that include APPEND flag. For example: [SSH.NET append API](https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/blob/develop/src/Renci.SshNet/SftpClient.cs#:~:text=public%20void-,AppendAllLines,-(string%20path%2C%20IEnumerable%3Cstring%3E%20contents)). |
| Links |<li>`symlink` - creating symbolic links<li>`ln` - creating hard links<li>Reading links not supported |
| Capacity Information | `df` - usage info for filesystem |
| Extensions | Unsupported extensions include but aren't limited to: fsync@openssh.com, limits@openssh.com, lsetstat@openssh.com, statvfs@openssh.com |
| SSH Commands | SFTP is the only supported subsystem. Shell requests after the completion of key exchange will fail. |
| Multi-protocol writes | Random writes and appends (`PutBlock`,`PutBlockList`, `GetBlockList`, `AppendBlock`, `AppendFile`)  aren't allowed from other protocols (NFS, Blob REST, Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST) on blobs that are created by using SFTP. Full overwrites are allowed.|

## Authentication and authorization
  
- _Local users_ is the only form of identity management that is currently supported for the SFTP endpoint.

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) isn't supported for the SFTP endpoint.

- POSIX-like access control lists (ACLs) aren't supported for the SFTP endpoint.

To learn more, see [SFTP permission model](secure-file-transfer-protocol-support.md#sftp-permission-model) and see [Access control model in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](data-lake-storage-access-control-model.md).

## Networking

- To access the storage account using SFTP, your network must allow traffic on port 22.
 
- Static IP addresses aren't supported for storage accounts. This is not an SFTP specific limitation.
  
- Internet routing is not supported. Use Microsoft network routing.

- There's a 2 minute timeout for idle or inactive connections. OpenSSH will appear to stop responding and then disconnect. Some clients reconnect automatically.

## Other

- For performance issues and considerations, see [SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) performance considerations in Azure Blob storage](secure-file-transfer-protocol-performance.md).
  
- Special containers such as $logs, $blobchangefeed, $root, $web aren't accessible via the SFTP endpoint. 

- Symbolic links aren't supported.

- SSH and SCP commands that aren't SFTP aren't supported.

- FTPS and FTP aren't supported.
  
- TLS and SSL aren't related to SFTP.

## Troubleshooting

- To resolve the `Failed to update SFTP settings for account 'accountname'. Error: The value 'True' is not allowed for property isSftpEnabled.` error, ensure that the following pre-requisites are met at the storage account level:

  - The account needs to be a general-purpose v2 and premium block blob accounts.
  
  - The account needs to have hierarchical namespace enabled on it.

- To resolve the `Home Directory not accessible error.` error, check that:
  
  - The user has been assigned appropriate permissions to the container.
  
  -	The container name is specified in the connection string for local users don't have a home directory.
  
  -	The container name is specified in the connection string for local users that have a home directory that doesn't exist.

- To resolve the `Received disconnect from XX.XXX.XX.XXX port 22:11:` when connecting, check that:
  
  - Public network access is `Enabled from all networks` or `Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses`.
  
  - The client IP address is allowed by the firewall.
  
  - Network Routing is set to `Microsoft network routing`.
