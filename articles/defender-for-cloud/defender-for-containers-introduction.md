# Overview of Microsoft Defender for Containers

Microsoft Defender for Containers is the cloud-native solution that is used to secure your containers so you can improve, monitor, and maintain the security of your clusters, containers, and their applications.

Defender for Containers assists you with the three core aspects of container security:

- [**Environment hardening**](#hardening) - Defender for Containers protects your Kubernetes clusters whether they're running on Azure Kubernetes Service, Kubernetes on-premises/IaaS, or Amazon EKS. Defender for Containers continuously assesses clusters to provide visibility into misconfigurations and guidelines to help mitigate identified threats.

- [**Vulnerability assessment**](#vulnerability-assessment) - Vulnerability assessment and management tools for images stored in ACR registries and running in Azure Kubernetes Service.

- [**Run-time threat protection for nodes and clusters**](#run-time-protection-for-kubernetes-nodes-and-clusters) - Threat protection for clusters and Linux nodes generates security alerts for suspicious activities.

You can learn more by watching this video from the Defender for Cloud in the Field video series: [Microsoft Defender for Containers](episode-three.md).

## Hardening

### Continuous monitoring of your Kubernetes clusters - wherever they're hosted

Defender for Cloud continuously assesses the configurations of your clusters and compares them with the initiatives applied to your subscriptions. When it finds misconfigurations, Defender for Cloud generates security recommendations that are available on Defender for Cloud's Recommendations page. The recommendations allow you to investigate and remediate issues. For details on the recommendations that might appear for this feature, check out the [compute section](recommendations-reference.md#recs-container) of the recommendations reference table.

For Kubernetes clusters on EKS, you'll need to [connect your AWS account to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](quickstart-onboard-aws.md) and ensure you've enabled the CSPM plan.

You can use the resource filter to review the outstanding recommendations for your container-related resources, whether in asset inventory or the recommendations page:

### Kubernetes data plane hardening

To protect the workloads of your Kubernetes containers with tailored recommendations, you can install the [Azure Policy for Kubernetes](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md). You can also auto deploy this component as explained in [enable auto provisioning of agents and extensions](enable-data-collection.md#auto-provision-mma).

With the add-on on your AKS cluster, every request to the Kubernetes API server will be monitored against the predefined set of best practices before being persisted to the cluster. You can then configure it to enforce the best practices and mandate them for future workloads.

For example, you can mandate that privileged containers shouldn't be created, and any future requests to do so will be blocked.

You can learn more about [Kubernetes data plane hardening](kubernetes-workload-protections.md).

## Vulnerability assessment

### Scanning images in ACR registries

Defender for Containers includes an integrated vulnerability scanner for scanning images in Azure Container Registry registries. The vulnerability scanner runs on an image:

  - When you push the image to your registry
  - Weekly on any image that was pulled within the last 30
  - When you import the image to your Azure Container Registry
  - Continuously in specific situations

Learn more in [Vulnerability assessment](defender-for-containers-usage.md).

### View vulnerabilities for running images

The recommendation `Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved` shows vulnerabilities for running images by using the scan results from ACR registries and information on running images from the Defender security profile/extension. Images that are deployed from a non-ACR registry, will appear under the Not applicable tab.

## Run-time protection for Kubernetes nodes and clusters

Defender for Containers provides real-time threat protection for your containerized environments and generates alerts for suspicious activities. You can use this information to quickly remediate security issues and improve the security of your containers. Threat protection at the cluster level is provided by the Defender profile and analysis of the Kubernetes audit logs. Examples of events at this level include exposed Kubernetes dashboards, creation of high-privileged roles, and the creation of sensitive mounts.

In addition, our threat detection goes beyond the Kubernetes management layer. Defender for Containers includes host-level threat detection with over 60 Kubernetes-aware analytics, AI, and anomaly detections based on your runtime workload.

This solution monitors the growing attack surface of multicloud Kubernetes deployments and tracks the [MITRE ATT&CK® matrix for Containers](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/04/29/center-for-threat-informed-defense-teams-up-with-microsoft-partners-to-build-the-attck-for-containers-matrix/), a framework that was developed by the [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://mitre-engenuity.org/ctid/) in close partnership with Microsoft and others.

## FAQ - Defender for Containers

- [Does Microsoft Defender for Containers support AKS without scale set (default)?](#does-microsoft-defender-for-containers-support-aks-without-scale-set-default)
- [Do I need to install the Log Analytics VM extension on my AKS nodes for security protection?](#do-i-need-to-install-the-log-analytics-vm-extension-on-my-aks-nodes-for-security-protection)

### What are the options to enable the new plan at scale?

You can use the Azure Policy `Configure Microsoft Defender for Containers to be enabled`, to enable Defender for Containers at scale. You can also see all of the options that are available to [enable Microsoft Defender for Containers](defender-for-containers-enable.md).

### Does Microsoft Defender for Containers support AKS clusters with virtual machines scale sets?

Yes.

### Does Microsoft Defender for Containers support AKS without scale set (default)?

No. Only Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters that use virtual machine scale sets for the nodes is supported.

### Do I need to install the Log Analytics VM extension on my AKS nodes for security protection?

No, AKS is a managed service, and manipulation of the IaaS resources isn't supported. The Log Analytics VM extension isn't needed and may result in extra charges.
