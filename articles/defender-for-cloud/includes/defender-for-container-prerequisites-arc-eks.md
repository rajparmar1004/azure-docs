## Network requirements

Validate the following endpoints are configured for outbound access so that the Defender extension can connect to Microsoft Defender for Cloud to send security data and events:

For Azure public cloud deployments:

| Domain                     | Port |
| -------------------------- | ---- |
| *.ods.opinsights.azure.com | 443  |
| *.oms.opinsights.azure.com | 443  |
| login.microsoftonline.com  | 443  |

You'll also need to validate the [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes network requirements](../../azure-arc/kubernetes/quickstart-connect-cluster.md#meet-network-requirements).
