# Analyzing product usage with HEART
This article describes how to enable and use the Heart Workbook on Azure Monitor. The HEART workbook is based on the HEART measurement framework, originally introduced by Google. Several Microsoft internal teams use HEART to deliver better software.

 
## Overview
HEART is an acronym that stands for Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task Success. It helps product teams deliver better software by focusing on the following five dimensions of customer experience:

 

- **Happiness**: Measure of user attitude  
- **Engagement**: Level of active user involvement 
- **Adoption**: Target audience penetration
- **Retention**: Rate at which users return  
- **Task Success**: Productivity empowerment 

These dimensions are measured independently, but they interact with each other as shown below:

:::image type="content" source="media/usage-overview/heart-funnel.png" alt-text="Image that displays the funnel relationship between HEART dimensions. The funnel path is as follows: Adoption to Engagement to Retention to Happiness. Task Success is a driver of this funnel":::



- Adoption, engagement, and retention form a user activity funnel. Only a portion of users who adopt the tool come back to use it.
- Task success is the driver that progresses users down the funnel and moves them from adoption to retention.
- Happiness is an outcome of the other dimensions and not a stand-alone measurement. Users who have progressed down the funnel and are showing a higher level of activity should ideally be happier.

### Open the workbook
The workbook can be found in the gallery under 'public templates'. The workbook will be shown in the section titled **"Product Analytics using the Click Analytics Plugin"** as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="media/usage-overview/workbook-gallery.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting location of the HEART workbooks in Azure App Insights.":::

Users will notice that there are seven workbooks as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="media/usage-overview/heart-workbook-templates.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the names of the seven HEART workbooks under public templates in Azure App Insights' Workbook section":::


The workbook is designed in a way that users only have to interact with the main workbook, 'HEART Analytics - All Sections'. This workbook contains the rest of the six workbooks as tabs. If needed, users can access the individual workbooks related to reach tab through the gallery as well.


### Confirm data is flowing

See the "Development Requirements" tab as shown below to validate that data is flowing as expected to light up the metrics accurately. 

:::image type="content" source="media/usage-overview/development-requirements-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting the 'Development Requirements' tab of the 'HEART Analytics - All Sections' workbook":::

If the data isn't flowing as expected, this tab will highlight the specific attributes with issues as shown in the below example.

:::image type="content" source="media/usage-overview/development-requirements-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot highlighting data discrepancies in the 'Development Requirements' tab of the HEART workbook":::


## Workbook structure
The workbook shows metric trends for the HEART dimensions split over eight tabs. Each tab contains descriptions of the dimensions, the metrics contained within each dimension, and how to use them.

A brief description of the tabs can be seen below: 

- **Summary tab** - Usage funnel metrics giving a high-level view of visits, interactions, and repeat usage. 
- **Adoption** - This tab helps understand what is the penetration among the target audience, acquisition velocity, and total user base. 
- **Engagement** -  Frequency, depth, and breadth of usage. 
- **Retention** - Repeat usage 
- **Task success** - Enabling understanding of user flows and their time distributions. 
- **Happiness** -  We recommend using a survey tool to measure customer satisfaction score (CSAT) over a 5-point scale. In this tab, we've provided the likelihood of happiness by using usage and performance metrics. 
- **Feature metrics** - Enables understanding of HEART metrics at feature granularity. 

> [!WARNING]
> The HEART Workbook is currently built on logs and effectively are [log-based metrics](pre-aggregated-metrics-log-metrics.md). The accuracy of these metrics will be negatively affected by sampling and filtering.
## How HEART dimensions are defined and measured

### Happiness

Happiness is a user-reported dimension that measures how users feel about the product offered to them. 

A common approach to measure happiness is to ask users a Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) question like *How satisfied are you with this product?*. Users' responses on a three or a five-point scale (for example, *no, maybe,* and *yes*) are aggregated to create a product-level score ranging from 1-5. Since user-initiated feedback tends to be negatively biased, HEART tracks happiness from surveys displayed to users at pre-defined intervals.

Common happiness metrics include values such as *Average Star Rating* and *Customer Satisfaction Score*. Send these values to Azure Monitor using one of the custom ingestion methods described in [Custom sources](../data-sources.md#custom-sources).




### Engagement
Engagement is a measure of user activity, specifically intentional user actions such as clicks. Active usage can be broken down into three subdimensions:
- **Activity frequency** – Measures how often a user interacts with the product. For example, user typically interacts daily, weekly, or monthly.
- **Activity breadth** – Measures the number of features users interact with over a given time period. For example, users interacted with a total of five features in June 2021.
- **Activity depth** – Measures the number of features users interact with each time they launch the product. For example, users interacted with two features on every launch.

Measuring engagement can vary based on the type of product being used. For example, a product like Microsoft Teams is expected to have a high daily usage, making it an important metric to track. But for a product like a paycheck portal, measurement would make more sense at a monthly or weekly level.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>A user who does an intentional action such as clicking a button or typing an input is counted as an active user. For this reason, Engagement metrics require the [Click Analytics plugin for Application Insights](javascript-click-analytics-plugin.md) implemented in the application.



### Adoption

Adoption enables understanding of penetration among the relevant users, who we're gaining as our user base, and how we're gaining them. Adoption metrics are useful for measuring the below scenarios:

- Newly released products  
- Newly updated products  
- Marketing campaigns  



### Retention
A Retained user is a user who was active in a specified reporting period and its previous reporting period. Retention is typically measured with the following metrics:

| Metric         | Definition                                                                          | Question Answered                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retained users | Count of active users who were also Active the previous period                      | How many users are staying engaged with the product?        |
| Retention      | Proportion of active users from the previous period who are also Active this period | What percent of users are staying engaged with the product? |

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Since active users must have at least one telemetry event with an actionType, Retention metrics require the [Click Analytics plugin for Application Insights](javascript-click-analytics-plugin.md) implemented in the application.


### Task success
Task success tracks whether users can do a task efficiently and effectively using the product's features. Many products include structures that are designed to funnel users through completing a task. Some examples include:
- Add items to a cart and then complete a purchase
- Search a keyword and then click on a result
- Start a new account and then complete account registration

A successful task meets three requirements:
- Expected task flow - The intended task flow of the feature was completed by the user and aligns with the expected task flow.
- High performance - The intended functionality of the feature was accomplished in a reasonable amount of time.
- High reliability – The intended functionality of the feature was accomplished without failure.

A task is considered unsuccessful if any of the above requirements isn't met.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Task success metrics require the [Click Analytics plugin for Application Insights](javascript-click-analytics-plugin.md) implemented in the application.

Set up a custom task using the below parameters.

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| First step           | The feature that starts the task. Using the cart/purchase example above, "adding items to a cart" would be the First step.                                                                                                          |
| Expected task duration | The time window to consider a completed task a success. Any tasks completed outside of this constraint is considered a failure. Not all tasks necessarily have a time constraint: for such tasks, select "No Time Expectation". |
| Last step        | The feature that completes the task. Using the cart/purchase example above, "purchasing items from the cart" would be the Last step.                                                                                               |
