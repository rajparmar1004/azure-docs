# Search jobs in Azure Monitor (preview)

Search jobs are asynchronous queries that fetch records into a new search table within your workspace for further analytics. The search job uses parallel processing and can run for hours across extremely large datasets. This article describes how to create a search job and how to query its resulting data.

> [!NOTE]
> The search job feature is currently in public preview and is not supported in workspaces with [customer-managed keys](customer-managed-keys.md).

## When to use search jobs

Use a search job when the log query timeout of 10 minutes isn't enough time to search through large volumes of data or when you're running a slow query.

Search jobs also let you retrieve records from [Archived Logs](data-retention-archive.md) and [Basic Logs](basic-logs-configure.md) tables into a new log table you can use for queries. In this way, running a search job can be an alternative to:

- [Restoring data from Archived Logs](restore.md) for a specific time range.<br/>
    Use restore when you have a temporary need to run many queries on a large volume of data. 

- Querying Basic Logs directly and paying for each query.<br/>
    To decide which alternative is more cost-effective, compare the cost of querying Basic Logs with the cost of performing a search job and storing the resulting data based on your needs.

## What does a search job do?

A search job sends its results to a new table in the same workspace as the source data. The results table is available as soon as the search job begins, but it may take time for results to begin to appear. 

The search job results table is a [Log Analytics](log-analytics-workspace-overview.md#log-data-plans-preview) table that is available for log queries and other Azure Monitor features that use tables in a workspace. The table uses the [retention value](data-retention-archive.md) set for the workspace, but you can modify this value after the table is created.

The search results table schema is based on the source table schema and the specified query. The following additional columns help you track the source records:

| Column | Value |
|:---|:---|
| _OriginalType          | *Type* value from source table. |
| _OriginalItemId        | *_ItemID* value from source table. |
| _OriginalTimeGenerated | *TimeGenerated* value from source table. |
| TimeGenerated          | Time at which the search job retrieved the record from the original table. |

Queries on the results table appear in [log query auditing](query-audit.md) but not the initial search job.

## Create a search job

# [API](#tab/api-1)
To run a search job, call the **Tables - Create or Update** API. The call includes the name of the results table to be created. The name of the results table must end with *_SRCH*.
 
```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/<TableName>_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

**Request body**

Include the following values in the body of the request:

|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|properties.searchResults.query | string  | Log query written in KQL to retrieve data. |
|properties.searchResults.limit | integer  | Maximum number of records in the result set, up to one million records. (Optional)|
|properties.searchResults.startSearchTime | string  |Start of the time range to search. |
|properties.searchResults.endSearchTime | string  | End of the time range to search. |


**Sample request**

This example creates a table called *Syslog_suspected_SRCH* with the results of a query that searches for particular records in the *Syslog* table.

**Request**

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourcegroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/testWS/tables/Syslog_suspected_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

**Request body**

```json
{
    "properties": { 
        "searchResults": {
                "query": "Syslog | where * has 'suspected.exe'",
                "limit": 1000,
                "startSearchTime": "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "endSearchTime": "2020-01-31T00:00:00Z"
            }
    }
}
```

**Response**

Status code: 202 accepted.

# [CLI](#tab/cli-1)

To run a search job, run the [az monitor log-analytics workspace table search-job create](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/table/search-job#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-table-search-job-create) command. The name of the results table, which you set using the `--name` parameter, must end with *_SRCH*.

For example:

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics workspace table search-job create --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG  --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name HeartbeatByIp_SRCH --search-query 'Heartbeat | where ComputerIP has "00.000.00.000"' --limit 1500 --start-search-time "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" --end-search-time "2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z" --no-wait
```

## Get search job status and details

# [API](#tab/api-2)

Call the **Tables - Get** API to get the status and details of a search job:
```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/<TableName>_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

**Table status**<br>

Each search job table has a property called *provisioningState*, which can have one of the following values:

| Status | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Updating | Populating the table and its schema. |
| InProgress | Search job is running, fetching data. |
| Succeeded | Search job completed. |
| Deleting | Deleting the search job table. |


**Sample request**

This example retrieves the table status for the search job in the previous example.

**Request**

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourcegroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/testWS/tables/Syslog_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

**Response**

```json

        },
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
    },
    "id": "subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourcegroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/testWS/tables/Syslog_SRCH",
    "name": "Syslog_SRCH"
}
```

# [CLI](#tab/cli-2)

To check the status and details of a search job table, run the [az monitor log-analytics workspace table show](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/table#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-table-show) command.

For example:

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics workspace table show --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name HeartbeatByIp_SRCH --output table \
```

---

## Delete search job table
We recommend deleting the search job table when you're done querying the table. This reduces workspace clutter and extra charges for data retention. 

# [API](#tab/api-3)

To delete a table, call the **Tables - Delete** API: 

```http
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/<TableName>_SRCH?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

# [CLI](#tab/cli-3)

To delete a search table, run the [az monitor log-analytics workspace table delete](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/table#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-table-delete) command.

For example:

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics workspace table delete --subscription ContosoSID --resource-group ContosoRG --workspace-name ContosoWorkspace --name HeartbeatByIp_SRCH
```

## Limitations
Search jobs are subject to the following limitations:

- Optimized to query one table at a time.
- Search date range is up to one year.
- Supports long running searches up to a 24-hour time-out.
- Results are limited to one million records in the record set.
- Concurrent execution is limited to five search jobs per workspace.
- Limited to 100 search results tables per workspace.
- Limited to 100 search job executions per day per workspace. 

When you reach the record limit, Azure aborts the job with a status of *partial success*, and the table will contain only records ingested up to that point. 

### KQL query limitations
Log queries in a search job are intended to scan very large sets of data. To support distribution and segmentation, the queries use a subset of KQL, including the operators: 

- [where](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/whereoperator)
- [extend](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/extendoperator)
- [project](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectoperator)
- [project-away](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectawayoperator)
- [project-keep](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/project-keep-operator)
- [project-rename](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectrenameoperator)
- [project-reorder](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectreorderoperator)
- [parse](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/whereoperator)
- [parse-where](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/whereoperator)

You can use all functions and binary operators within these operators.

## Pricing model
The charge for a search job is based on: 

- The amount of data the search job needs to scan.
- The amount of data ingested in the results table.

For example, if your table holds 500 GB per day, for a query on three days, you'll be charged for 1500 GB of scanned data. If the job returns 1000 records, you'll be charged for ingesting these 1000 records into the results table. 

> [!NOTE]
> There is no charge for search jobs during the public preview. You'll be charged only for the ingestion of the results set.
