# Manage access to Log Analytics workspaces

 The data in a Log Analytics workspace that you can access is determined by a combination of the following factors:

- The settings on the workspace itself.
- The access to resources sending data to the workspace.
- The method used to access the workspace.

This article describes how access is managed and how to perform any required configuration.

## Overview

The factors that define the data you can access are described in the following table. Each factor is further described in the sections that follow.

| Factor | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Access mode](#access-mode) | Method used to access the workspace. Defines the scope of the data available and the access control mode that's applied. |
| [Access control mode](#access-control-mode) | Setting on the workspace that defines whether permissions are applied at the workspace or resource level. |
| [Azure role-based access control (RBAC)](#azure-rbac) | Permissions applied to individuals or groups of users for the workspace or resource sending data to the workspace. Defines what data you have access to. |
| [Table-level Azure RBAC](#table-level-azure-rbac) | Optional permissions that define specific data types in the workspace that you can access. Apply to all users no matter your access mode or access control mode. |

## Access mode

The *access mode* refers to how you access a Log Analytics workspace and defines the data you can access during the current session. The mode is determined according to the [scope](scope.md) you select in Log Analytics.

There are two access modes:

- **Workspace-context**: You can view all logs in the workspace for which you have permission. Queries in this mode are scoped to all data in all tables in the workspace. This access mode is used when logs are accessed with the workspace as the scope, such as when you select **Logs** on the **Azure Monitor** menu in the Azure portal.
 - **Resource-context**: When you access the workspace for a particular resource, resource group, or subscription, such as when you select **Logs** from a resource menu in the Azure portal, you can view logs for only resources in all tables that you have access to. Queries in this mode are scoped to only data associated with that resource. This mode also enables granular Azure RBAC. Workspaces use a resource-context log model where every log record emitted by an Azure resource is automatically associated with this resource.

Records are only available in resource-context queries if they're associated with the relevant resource. To check this association, run a query and verify that the [_ResourceId](./log-standard-columns.md#_resourceid) column is populated.

There are known limitations with the following resources:

- **Computers outside of Azure**: Resource-context is only supported with [Azure Arc for servers](../../azure-arc/servers/index.yml).
- **Application Insights**: Supported for resource-context only when using a [workspace-based Application Insights resource](../app/create-workspace-resource.md).
- **Azure Service Fabric**

### Compare access modes

The following table summarizes the access modes:

| Issue | Workspace-context | Resource-context |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Who is each model intended for? | Central administration.<br>Administrators who need to configure data collection and users who need access to a wide variety of resources. Also currently required for users who need to access logs for resources outside of Azure. | Application teams.<br>Administrators of Azure resources being monitored. Allows them to focus on their resource without filtering. |
| What does a user require to view logs? | Permissions to the workspace.<br>See "Workspace permissions" in [Manage access using workspace permissions](./manage-access.md#azure-rbac). | Read access to the resource.<br>See "Resource permissions" in [Manage access using Azure permissions](./manage-access.md#azure-rbac). Permissions can be inherited from the resource group or subscription or directly assigned to the resource. Permission to the logs for the resource will be automatically assigned. The user doesn't require access to the workspace.|
| What is the scope of permissions? | Workspace.<br>Users with access to the workspace can query all logs in the workspace from tables they have permissions to. See [Table access control](./manage-access.md#table-level-azure-rbac). | Azure resource.<br>Users can query logs for specific resources, resource groups, or subscriptions they have access to in any workspace, but they can't query logs for other resources. |
| How can a user access logs? | On the **Azure Monitor** menu, select **Logs**.<br><br>Select **Logs** from **Log Analytics workspaces**.<br><br>From Azure Monitor [workbooks](../best-practices-analysis.md#workbooks). | Select **Logs** on the menu for the Azure resource. Users will have access to data for that resource.<br><br>Select **Logs** on the **Azure Monitor** menu. Users will have access to data for all resources they have access to.<br><br>Select **Logs** from **Log Analytics workspaces**. Users will have access to data for all resources they have access to.<br><br>From Azure Monitor [workbooks](../best-practices-analysis.md#workbooks). |

## Access control mode

The *access control mode* is a setting on each workspace that defines how permissions are determined for the workspace.

* **Require workspace permissions**. This control mode doesn't allow granular Azure RBAC. To access the workspace, the user must be [granted permissions to the workspace](#azure-rbac) or to [specific tables](#table-level-azure-rbac).

    If a user accesses the workspace in [workspace-context mode](#access-mode), they have access to all data in any table they've been granted access to. If a user accesses the workspace in [resource-context mode](#access-mode), they have access to only data for that resource in any table they've been granted access to.

    This setting is the default for all workspaces created before March 2019.

* **Use resource or workspace permissions**. This control mode allows granular Azure RBAC. Users can be granted access to only data associated with resources they can view by assigning Azure `read` permission.

    When a user accesses the workspace in [workspace-context mode](#access-mode), workspace permissions apply. When a user accesses the workspace in [resource-context mode](#access-mode), only resource permissions are verified, and workspace permissions are ignored. Enable Azure RBAC for a user by removing them from workspace permissions and allowing their resource permissions to be recognized.

    This setting is the default for all workspaces created after March 2019.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a user has only resource permissions to the workspace, they can only access the workspace by using resource-context mode assuming the workspace access mode is set to **Use resource or workspace permissions**.

### Configure access control mode for a workspace

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

View the current workspace access control mode on the **Overview** page for the workspace in the **Log Analytics workspace** menu.

![Screenshot that shows the workspace access control mode.](media/manage-access/view-access-control-mode.png)

Change this setting on the **Properties** page of the workspace. If you don't have permissions to configure the workspace, changing the setting is disabled.

![Screenshot that shows changing workspace access mode.](media/manage-access/change-access-control-mode.png)

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Use the following command to view the access control mode for all workspaces in the subscription:

```powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces -ExpandProperties | foreach {$_.Name + ": " + $_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions}
```

The output should resemble the following:

```
DefaultWorkspace38917: True
DefaultWorkspace21532: False
```

A value of `False` means the workspace is configured with *workspace-context* access mode. A value of `True` means the workspace is configured with *resource-context* access mode.

> [!NOTE]
> If a workspace is returned without a Boolean value and is blank, this result also matches the results of a `False` value.
>

Use the following script to set the access control mode for a specific workspace to *resource-context* permission:

```powershell
$WSName = "my-workspace"
$Workspace = Get-AzResource -Name $WSName -ExpandProperties
if ($Workspace.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions -eq $null)
    { $Workspace.Properties.features | Add-Member enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions $true -Force }
else
    { $Workspace.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions = $true }
Set-AzResource -ResourceId $Workspace.ResourceId -Properties $Workspace.Properties -Force
```

Use the following script to set the access control mode for all workspaces in the subscription to *resource-context* permission:

```powershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceType Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces -ExpandProperties | foreach {
if ($_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions -eq $null)
    { $_.Properties.features | Add-Member enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions $true -Force }
else
    { $_.Properties.features.enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions = $true }
Set-AzResource -ResourceId $_.ResourceId -Properties $_.Properties -Force
}
```

# [Resource Manager](#tab/arm)

To configure the access mode in an Azure Resource Manager template, set the **enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions** feature flag on the workspace to one of the following values:

* **false**: Set the workspace to *workspace-context* permissions. This setting is the default if the flag isn't set.
* **true**: Set the workspace to *resource-context* permissions.

## Azure RBAC

Access to a workspace is managed by using [Azure RBAC](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md). To grant access to the Log Analytics workspace by using Azure permissions, follow the steps in [Assign Azure roles to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

### Workspace permissions

Each workspace can have multiple accounts associated with it. Each account can have access to multiple workspaces. The following table lists the Azure permissions for different workspace actions:

|Action |Azure permissions needed |Notes |
|-------|-------------------------|------|
| Change the pricing tier. | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/*/write` | 
| Create a workspace in the Azure portal. | `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*` <br> `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/*` |
| View workspace basic properties and enter the workspace pane in the portal. | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read` |
| Query logs by using any interface. | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read` |
| Access all log types by using queries. | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/*/read` |
| Access a specific log table. | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/<table_name>/read` |
| Read the workspace keys to allow sending logs to this workspace. | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/sharedKeys/action` |
| Add and remove monitoring solutions. | `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*` <br> `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/*` <br> `Microsoft.OperationsManagement/*` <br> `Microsoft.Automation/*` <br> `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*/write`<br><br>These permissions need to be granted at resource group or subscription level. |
| View data in the **Backup** and **Site Recovery** solution tiles. | Administrator/Co-administrator<br><br>Accesses resources deployed by using the classic deployment model. |

### Built-in roles

Assign users to these roles to give them access at different scopes:

* **Subscription**: Access to all workspaces in the subscription
* **Resource group**: Access to all workspaces in the resource group
* **Resource**: Access to only the specified workspace

Create assignments at the resource level (workspace) to assure accurate access control. Use [custom roles](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) to create roles with the specific permissions needed.

> [!NOTE]
> To add and remove users to a user role, you must have `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete` and `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write` permission.

#### Log Analytics Reader

| `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/deployments/*` | Create and delete deployments. Required for adding and removing solutions, workspaces, and automation accounts. |

### Resource permissions

When users query logs from a workspace by using [resource-context access](#access-mode), they'll have the following permissions on the resource:

| Permission | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `Microsoft.Insights/logs/<tableName>/read`<br><br>Examples:<br>`Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read`<br>`Microsoft.Insights/logs/Heartbeat/read` | Ability to view all log data for the resource  |
| `Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/write` | Ability to configure diagnostics setting to allow setting up logs for this resource |

The `/read` permission is usually granted from a role that includes _\*/read or_ _\*_ permissions, such as the built-in [Reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#reader) and [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) roles. Custom roles that include specific actions or dedicated built-in roles might not include this permission.

### Custom role examples

In addition to using the built-in roles for a Log Analytics workspace, you can create custom roles to assign more granular permissions. Here are some common examples.

Grant a user access to log data from their resources:

- Configure the workspace access control mode to *use workspace or resource permissions*.
- Grant users `*/read` or `Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read` permissions to their resources. If they're already assigned the [Log Analytics Reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#reader) role on the workspace, it's sufficient.

Grant a user access to log data from their resources and configure their resources to send logs to the workspace:

- Configure the workspace access control mode to *use workspace or resource permissions*.
- Grant users the following permissions on the workspace: `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read` and `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/sharedKeys/action`. With these permissions, users can't perform any workspace-level queries. They can only enumerate the workspace and use it as a destination for diagnostic settings or agent configuration.
- Grant users the following permissions to their resources: `Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read` and `Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/write`. If they're already assigned the [Log Analytics Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) role, assigned the Reader role, or granted `*/read` permissions on this resource, it's sufficient.

Grant a user access to log data from their resources without being able to read security events and send data:

- Configure the workspace access control mode to *use workspace or resource permissions*.
- Grant users the following permissions to their resources: `Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read`.
- Add the following NonAction to block users from reading the SecurityEvent type: `Microsoft.Insights/logs/SecurityEvent/read`. The NonAction shall be in the same custom role as the action that provides the read permission (`Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read`). If the user inherits the read action from another role that's assigned to this resource or to the subscription or resource group, they could read all log types. This scenario is also true if they inherit `*/read` that exists, for example, with the Reader or Contributor role.

Grant a user access to log data from their resources and read all Azure AD sign-in and read Update Management solution log data from the workspace:

- Configure the workspace access control mode to *use workspace or resource permissions*.
- Grant users the following permissions on the workspace:
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read`: Required so the user can enumerate the workspace and open the workspace pane in the Azure portal
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read`: Required for every user that can execute queries
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/SigninLogs/read`: To be able to read Azure AD sign-in logs
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/Update/read`: To be able to read Update Management solution logs
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/UpdateRunProgress/read`: To be able to read Update Management solution logs
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/UpdateSummary/read`: To be able to read Update Management logs
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/Heartbeat/read`: Required to be able to use Update Management solutions
  - `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/ComputerGroup/read`: Required to be able to use Update Management solutions
- Grant users the following permissions to their resources: `*/read`, assigned to the Reader role, or `Microsoft.Insights/logs/*/read`

## Table-level Azure RBAC

By using table-level Azure RBAC, you can define more granular control to data in a Log Analytics workspace by defining specific data types that are accessible only to a specific set of users.

Implement table access control with [Azure custom roles](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) to grant access to specific [tables](../logs/data-platform-logs.md) in the workspace. These roles are applied to workspaces with either workspace-context or resource-context [access control modes](#access-control-mode) regardless of the user's [access mode](#access-mode).

Create a [custom role](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) with the following actions to define access to a particular table:

* Include the **Actions** section of the role definition. To subtract access from the allowed **Actions**, include it in the **NotActions** section.
* Use `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/*` to specify all tables.

### Examples

Here are examples of custom role actions to grant and deny access to specific tables.

Grant access to the _Heartbeat_ and _AzureActivity_ tables:

```
"Actions":  [
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/Heartbeat/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/AzureActivity/read"
  ],
```

Grant access to only the _SecurityBaseline_ table:

```
"Actions":  [
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/SecurityBaseline/read"
],
```


Grant access to all tables except the _SecurityAlert_ table:

```
"Actions":  [
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/*/read"
],
"notActions":  [
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/SecurityAlert/read"
],
```

### Custom logs

 Custom logs are tables created from data sources such as [text logs](../agents/data-sources-custom-logs.md) and the [HTTP Data Collector API](data-collector-api.md). The easiest way to identify the type of log is by checking the tables listed under [Custom Logs in the log schema](./log-analytics-tutorial.md#view-table-information).

> [!NOTE]
> Tables created by the [Logs ingestion API](../essentials/../logs/logs-ingestion-api-overview.md) don't yet support table-level RBAC.

 You can't grant access to individual custom log tables, but you can grant access to all custom logs. To create a role with access to all custom log tables, create a custom role by using the following actions:

```
"Actions":  [
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/read",
    "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/query/Tables.Custom/read"
],
```

An alternative approach to managing access to custom logs is to assign them to an Azure resource and manage access by using resource-context access control. Include the resource ID by specifying it in the [x-ms-AzureResourceId](../logs/data-collector-api.md#request-headers) header when data is ingested to Log Analytics via the [HTTP Data Collector API](../logs/data-collector-api.md). The resource ID must be valid and have access rules applied to it. After the logs are ingested, they're accessible to users with read access to the resource.

Some custom logs come from sources that aren't directly associated to a specific resource. In this case, create a resource group to manage access to these logs. The resource group doesn't incur any cost, but it gives you a valid resource ID to control access to the custom logs.

For example, if a specific firewall is sending custom logs, create a resource group called *MyFireWallLogs*. Make sure that the API requests contain the resource ID of *MyFireWallLogs*. The firewall log records are then accessible only to users who were granted access to *MyFireWallLogs* or those users with full workspace access.

### Considerations

- If a user is granted global read permission with the standard Reader or Contributor roles that include the _\*/read_ action, it will override the per-table access control and give them access to all log data.
- If a user is granted per-table access but no other permissions, they can access log data from the API but not from the Azure portal. To provide access from the Azure portal, use Log Analytics Reader as its base role.
- Administrators and owners of the subscription will have access to all data types regardless of any other permission settings.
- Workspace owners are treated like any other user for per-table access control.
- Assign roles to security groups instead of individual users to reduce the number of assignments. This practice will also help you use existing group management tools to configure and verify access.
