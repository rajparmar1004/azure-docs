# Azure Monitor agent overview
The Azure Monitor agent (AMA) collects monitoring data from the guest operating system of [supported infrastucture](#supported-resource-types) and delivers it to Azure Monitor. This article provides an overview of the Azure Monitor agent and includes information on how to install it and how to configure data collection.
Here's an **introductory video** explaining all about this new agent, including a quick demo of how to set things up using the Azure portal:  [ITOps Talk: Azure Monitor Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8bIrFU8tCs)

## Relationship to other agents
Eventually, the Azure Monitor agent will replace the following legacy monitoring agents that are currently used by Azure Monitor.

- [Log Analytics agent](./log-analytics-agent.md): Sends data to a Log Analytics workspace and supports VM insights and monitoring solutions.
- [Telegraf agent](../essentials/collect-custom-metrics-linux-telegraf.md): Sends data to Azure Monitor Metrics (Linux only).
- [Diagnostics extension](./diagnostics-extension-overview.md): Sends data to Azure Monitor Metrics (Windows only), Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Storage.

**Currently**, the Azure Monitor agent consolidates features from the Telegraf agent and Log Analytics agent, with [a few limitations](#current-limitations).
In future, it will also consolidate features from the Diagnostic extensions.

In addition to consolidating this functionality into a single agent, the Azure Monitor agent provides the following benefits over the existing agents:

- **Cost savings:**
  -	Granular targeting via [Data Collection Rules](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md) to collect specific data types from specific machines, as compared to the "all or nothing" mode that Log Analytics agent supports
  -	Use XPath queries to filter Windows events that get collected. This helps further reduce ingestion and storage costs.
- **Simplified management of data collection:** Send data from Windows and Linux VMs to multiple Log Analytics workspaces (i.e. "multi-homing") and/or other [supported destinations](#data-sources-and-destinations). Additionally, every action across the data collection lifecycle, from onboarding to deployment to updates, is significantly easier, scalable, and centralized (in Azure) using data collection rules
- **Management of dependent solutions or services:** The Azure Monitor agent uses a new method of handling extensibility that's more transparent and controllable than management packs and Linux plug-ins in the legacy Log Analytics agents. Moreover this management experience is identical for machines in Azure or on-premises/other clouds via Azure Arc, at no added cost.
- **Security and performance** - For authentication and security, it uses Managed Identity (for virtual machines) and AAD device tokens (for clients) which are both much more secure and ‘hack proof’ than certificates or workspace keys that legacy agents use. This agent performs better at higher EPS (events per second upload rate)  compared to legacy agents.


### Current limitations
 Not all Log Analytics solutions are supported yet. [View supported features and services](#supported-services-and-features).

### Changes in data collection
The methods for defining data collection for the existing agents are distinctly different from each other. Each method has challenges that are addressed with the Azure Monitor agent.

- The Log Analytics agent gets its configuration from a Log Analytics workspace. It's easy to centrally configure but difficult to define independent definitions for different virtual machines. It can only send data to a Log Analytics workspace.
- Diagnostic extension has a configuration for each virtual machine. It's easy to define independent definitions for different virtual machines but difficult to centrally manage. It can only send data to Azure Monitor Metrics, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure Storage. For Linux agents, the open-source Telegraf agent is required to send data to Azure Monitor Metrics.

The Azure Monitor agent uses [data collection rules](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md) to configure data to collect from each agent. Data collection rules enable manageability of collection settings at scale while still enabling unique, scoped configurations for subsets of machines. They're independent of the workspace and independent of the virtual machine, which allows them to be defined once and reused across machines and environments. See [Configure data collection for the Azure Monitor agent](data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md).

## Should I switch to the Azure Monitor agent?
To start transitioning your VMs off the current agents to the new agent, consider the following factors:

- **Environment requirements:** The Azure Monitor agent supports [these operating systems](./agents-overview.md#supported-operating-systems) today. Support for future operating system versions, environment support, and networking requirements will only be provided in this new agent. If the Azure Monitor agent supports your current environment, start transitioning to it.

- **Current and new feature requirements:** The Azure Monitor agent introduces several new capabilities, such as filtering, scoping, and multi-homing. But it isn't at parity yet with the current agents for other functionality. View [current limitations](#current-limitations) and [supported solutions](#supported-services-and-features).

  That said, most new capabilities in Azure Monitor will be made available only with the Azure Monitor agent. Review whether the Azure Monitor agent has the features you require and if there are some features that you can temporarily do without to get other important features in the new agent.

  If the Azure Monitor agent has all the core capabilities you require, start transitioning to it. If there are critical features that you require, continue with the current agent until the Azure Monitor agent reaches parity.
- **Tolerance for rework:** If you're setting up a new environment with resources such as deployment scripts and onboarding templates, assess the effort involved. If the setup will take a significant amount of work, consider setting up your new environment with the new agent as it's now generally available.

  Azure Monitor's Log Analytics agent is retiring on 31 August 2024. The current agents will be supported until the retirement date.

## Coexistence with other agents
The Azure Monitor agent can coexist (run side by side on the same machine) with the legacy Log Analytics agents so that you can continue to use their existing functionality during evaluation or migration. While this allows you to begin transition given the limitations, you must review the below points carefully:
- Be careful in collecting duplicate data because it could skew query results and affect downstream features like alerts, dashboards or workbooks. For example, VM insights uses the Log Analytics agent to send performance data to a Log Analytics workspace. You might also have configured the workspace to collect Windows events and Syslog events from agents. If you install the Azure Monitor agent and create a data collection rule for these same events and performance data, it will result in duplicate data. As such, ensure you're not collecting the same data from both agents. If you are, ensure they're **collecting from different machines** or **going to separate destinations**.
- Besides data duplication, this would also generate more charges for data ingestion and retention.
- Running two telemetry agents on the same machine would result in double the resource consumption, including but not limited to CPU, memory, storage space and network bandwidth.
> [!NOTE]
> When using both agents during evaluation or migration, you can use the **'Category'** column of the [Heartbeat](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/Heartbeat) table in your Log Analytics workspace, and filter for 'Azure Monitor Agent'.

## Costs
There's no cost for the Azure Monitor agent, but you might incur charges for the data ingested. For details on Log Analytics data collection and retention and for customer metrics, see [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).


## Security
The Azure Monitor agent doesn't require any keys but instead requires a [system-assigned managed identity](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md#system-assigned-managed-identity). You must have a system-assigned managed identity enabled on each virtual machine before you deploy the agent.

## Networking
The Azure Monitor agent supports Azure service tags (both *AzureMonitor* and *AzureResourceManager* tags are required). It supports connecting via **direct proxies, Log Analytics gateway, and private links** as described below.

### Firewall requirements

If using private links on the agent, you must also add the [DCE endpoints](../essentials/data-collection-endpoint-overview.md#components-of-a-data-collection-endpoint)

### Proxy configuration
If the machine connects through a proxy server to communicate over the internet, review requirements below to understand the network configuration required.

The Azure Monitor agent extensions for Windows and Linux can communicate either through a proxy server or a [Log Analytics gateway](./gateway.md) to Azure Monitor by using the HTTPS protocol. Use it for Azure virtual machines, Azure virtual machine scale sets, and Azure Arc for servers. Use the extensions settings for configuration as described in the following steps. Both anonymous and basic authentication by using a username and password are supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Proxy configuration is not supported for [Azure Monitor Metrics (preview)](../essentials/metrics-custom-overview.md) as a destination. As such, if you are sending metrics to this destination, it will use the public internet without any proxy.

1. Use this flowchart to determine the values of the *settings* and *protectedSettings* parameters first.

    ![Flowchart to determine the values of settings and protectedSettings parameters when you enable the extension.](media/azure-monitor-agent-overview/proxy-flowchart.png)

2. After the values for the *settings* and *protectedSettings* parameters are determined, **provide these additional parameters** when you deploy the Azure Monitor agent by using PowerShell commands. Refer to the following examples.

# [Windows VM](#tab/PowerShellWindows)

```powershell
$settingsString = '{"proxy":{"mode":"application","address":"http://[address]:[port]","auth": true}}';
$protectedSettingsString = '{"proxy":{"username":"[username]","password": "[password]"}}';

Set-AzVMExtension -ExtensionName AzureMonitorWindowsAgent -ExtensionType AzureMonitorWindowsAgent -Publisher Microsoft.Azure.Monitor -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -VMName <virtual-machine-name> -Location <location> -TypeHandlerVersion 1.0 -SettingString $settingsString -ProtectedSettingString $protectedSettingsString
```

# [Linux VM](#tab/PowerShellLinux)
```powershell
$settingsString = '{"proxy":{"mode":"application","address":"http://[address]:[port]","auth": true}}';
$protectedSettingsString = '{"proxy":{"username":"[username]","password": "[password]"}}';

Set-AzVMExtension -ExtensionName AzureMonitorLinuxAgent -ExtensionType AzureMonitorLinuxAgent -Publisher Microsoft.Azure.Monitor -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -VMName <virtual-machine-name> -Location <location> -TypeHandlerVersion 1.5 -SettingString $settingsString -ProtectedSettingString $protectedSettingsString
```

# [Windows Arc enabled server](#tab/PowerShellWindowsArc)
```powershell
$settingsString = '{"proxy":{"mode":"application","address":"http://[address]:[port]","auth": true}}';
$protectedSettingsString = '{"proxy":{"username":"[username]","password": "[password]"}}';

New-AzConnectedMachineExtension -Name AzureMonitorWindowsAgent -ExtensionType AzureMonitorWindowsAgent -Publisher Microsoft.Azure.Monitor -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -MachineName <arc-server-name> -Location <arc-server-location> -Setting $settingsString -ProtectedSetting $protectedSettingsString
```

# [Linux Arc enabled server](#tab/PowerShellLinuxArc)
```powershell
$settingsString = '{"proxy":{"mode":"application","address":"http://[address]:[port]","auth": true}}';
$protectedSettingsString = '{"proxy":{"username":"[username]","password": "[password]"}}';

New-AzConnectedMachineExtension -Name AzureMonitorLinuxAgent -ExtensionType AzureMonitorLinuxAgent -Publisher Microsoft.Azure.Monitor -ResourceGroupName <resource-group-name> -MachineName <arc-server-name> -Location <arc-server-location> -Setting $settingsString -ProtectedSetting $protectedSettingsString
```

### Log Analytics gateway configuration
1. Follow the instructions above to configure proxy settings on the agent and provide the IP address and port number corresponding to the gateway server. If you have deployed multiple gateway servers behind a load balancer, the agent proxy configuration is the virtual IP address of the load balancer instead.
2. Add the **configuration endpoint URL** to fetch data collection rules to the allowlist for the gateway
   `Add-OMSGatewayAllowedHost -Host global.handler.control.monitor.azure.com`
   `Add-OMSGatewayAllowedHost -Host <gateway-server-region-name>.handler.control.monitor.azure.com`
   (If using private links on the agent, you must also add the [dce endpoints](../essentials/data-collection-endpoint-overview.md#components-of-a-data-collection-endpoint))
3. Add the **data ingestion endpoint URL** to the allowlist for the gateway
   `Add-OMSGatewayAllowedHost -Host <log-analytics-workspace-id>.ods.opinsights.azure.com`
3. Restart the **OMS Gateway** service to apply the changes
   `Stop-Service -Name <gateway-name>`
   `Start-Service -Name <gateway-name>`

### Private link configuration
To configure the agent to use private links for network communications with Azure Monitor, follow instructions to [enable network isolation](./azure-monitor-agent-data-collection-endpoint.md#enable-network-isolation-for-the-azure-monitor-agent) using [data collection endpoints](azure-monitor-agent-data-collection-endpoint.md).

## Next steps

- [Install the Azure Monitor agent](azure-monitor-agent-manage.md) on Windows and Linux virtual machines.
- [Create a data collection rule](data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md) to collect data from the agent and send it to Azure Monitor.
