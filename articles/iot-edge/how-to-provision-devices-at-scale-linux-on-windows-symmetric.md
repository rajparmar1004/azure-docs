# Create and provision IoT Edge for Linux on Windows devices at scale using symmetric keys

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-version-201806-or-202011](../../includes/iot-edge-version-201806-or-202011.md)]

This article provides end-to-end instructions for autoprovisioning one or more [IoT Edge for Linux on Windows](iot-edge-for-linux-on-windows.md) devices using symmetric keys. You can automatically provision Azure IoT Edge devices with the [Azure IoT Hub device provisioning service](../iot-dps/index.yml) (DPS). If you're unfamiliar with the process of autoprovisioning, review the [provisioning overview](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md#provisioning-process) before continuing.

>[!NOTE]
>The latest version of IoT Edge for Linux on Windows continuous release (CR), based on IoT Edge version 1.2, is in [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). A clean installation may be required for devices going into production use once the general availability (GA) release is available. For more information, see [EFLOW continuous release](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge-eflow/wiki/EFLOW-Continuous-Release).

The tasks are as follows:

1. Create either an **individual enrollment** for a single device or a **group enrollment** for a set of devices.
1. Deploy a Linux virtual machine with the IoT Edge runtime installed and connect it to the IoT Hub.

Symmetric key attestation is a simple approach to authenticating a device with a device provisioning service instance. This attestation method represents a "Hello world" experience for developers who are new to device provisioning, or do not have strict security requirements. Device attestation using a [TPM](../iot-dps/concepts-tpm-attestation.md) or [X.509 certificates](../iot-dps/concepts-x509-attestation.md) is more secure, and should be used for more stringent security requirements.

## Provision the device with its cloud identity

Once the runtime is installed on your device, configure the device with the information it uses to connect to the device provisioning service and IoT Hub.

Have the following information ready:

* The DPS **ID Scope** value
* The device **Registration ID** you created
* Either the **Primary Key** from an individual enrollment, or a [derived key](#derive-a-device-key) for devices using a group enrollment.

<!-- 1.1. -->
:::moniker range="iotedge-2018-06"

You can use either PowerShell or Windows Admin Center to provision your IoT Edge device.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

For PowerShell, run the following command with the placeholder values updated with your own values:

```powershell
Provision-EflowVm -provisioningType DpsSymmetricKey -â€‹scopeId PASTE_YOUR_ID_SCOPE_HERE -registrationId PASTE_YOUR_REGISTRATION_ID_HERE -symmKey PASTE_YOUR_PRIMARY_KEY_OR_DERIVED_KEY_HERE
```

# [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windowsadmincenter)

For Windows Admin Center, use the following steps:

1. On the **Azure IoT Edge device provisioning** pane, select **Symmetric Key (DPS)** from the provisioning method dropdown.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to your DPS instance.

1. Provide your DPS scope ID, device registration ID, and enrollment primary key or derived key in the Windows Admin Center fields.

1. Choose **Provisioning with the selected method**.

   ![Choose provisioning with the selected method after filling in the required fields for symmetric key provisioning, PNG.](./media/how-to-provision-devices-at-scale-linux-on-windows-symmetric/provisioning-with-selected-method-symmetric-key.png)

1. Once the provisioning is complete, select **Finish**. You will be taken back to the main dashboard. Now, you should see a new device listed, whose type is `IoT Edge Devices`. You can select the IoT Edge device to connect to it. Once on its **Overview** page, you can view the **IoT Edge Module List** and **IoT Edge Status** of your device.

Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session with the placeholder values updated with your own values:

```powershell
Provision-EflowVm -provisioningType DpsSymmetricKey -scopeId PASTE_YOUR_ID_SCOPE_HERE -registrationId PASTE_YOUR_REGISTRATION_ID_HERE -symmKey PASTE_YOUR_PRIMARY_KEY_OR_DERIVED_KEY_HERE
```

:::moniker-end
<!-- end iotedge-2020-11 -->

## Verify successful installation

Verify that IoT Edge for Linux on Windows was successfully installed and configured on your IoT Edge device.

# [Individual enrollment](#tab/individual-enrollment)

You can verify that the individual enrollment that you created in device provisioning service was used. Navigate to your device provisioning service instance in the Azure portal. Open the enrollment details for the individual enrollment that you created. Notice that the status of the enrollment is **assigned** and the device ID is listed.

# [Group enrollment](#tab/group-enrollment)

You can verify that the group enrollment that you created in device provisioning service was used. Navigate to your device provisioning service instance in the Azure portal. Open the enrollment details for the group enrollment that you created. Go to the **Registration Records** tab to view all devices registered in that group.

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

1. Log in to your IoT Edge for Linux on Windows virtual machine using the following command in your PowerShell session:

   ```powershell
   Connect-EflowVm
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >The only account allowed to SSH to the virtual machine is the user that created it.

1. Once you are logged in, you can check the list of running IoT Edge modules using the following Linux command:

   ```bash
   sudo iotedge list
   ```

1. If you need to troubleshoot the IoT Edge service, use the following Linux commands.

    1. Retrieve the service logs.

       ```bash
       sudo journalctl -u iotedge
       ```

    2. Use the `check` tool to verify configuration and connection status of the device.

       ```bash
       sudo iotedge check
       ```

# [Windows Admin Center](#tab/windowsadmincenter)

1. Select your IoT Edge device from the list of connected devices in Windows Admin Center to connect to it.

1. The device overview page displays some information about the device:

   * The **IoT Edge Module List** section shows running modules on the device. When the IoT Edge service starts for the first time, you should only see the **edgeAgent** module running. The edgeAgent module runs by default and helps to install and start any additional modules that you deploy to your device.

   * The **IoT Edge Status** section shows the service status, and should be reporting **active (running)**.

    1. Retrieve the service logs.

       ```bash
       sudo iotedge system logs
       ```

    2. Use the `check` tool to verify configuration and connection status of the device.

       ```bash
       sudo iotedge check
       ```

:::moniker-end
<!-- end iotedge-2020-11 -->

When you create a new IoT Edge device, it will display the status code `417 -- The device's deployment configuration is not set` in the Azure portal. This status is normal, and means that the device is ready to receive a module deployment.

## Next steps

The device provisioning service enrollment process lets you set the device ID and device twin tags at the same time as you provision the new device. You can use those values to target individual devices or groups of devices using automatic device management.
